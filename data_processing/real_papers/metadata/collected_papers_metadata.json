      "abstract": "Tomato leaf curl Palampur virus (ToLCPalV) is an economically important bipartite begomovirus in the agro-ecological regions in south and western Asia. This study was designed to investigate the sequence variation dynamics, regional delineation, genetic diversity, population structure, and cross-border dispersal patterns of ToLCPalV. The research revealed clear geographical structuring, with distinct Indo-Pak subcontinent and Middle Eastern clades, but no host-specific differentiation. Genetic diversity analysis indicated higher diversity in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, particularly in the DNA-B component, suggesting an older, more diverse population of ToLCPalV prevailing in this region. Neutrality tests and selection pressure analyses revealed predominantly purifying selection, with limited positive selection observed in BV1 of DNA-B. The primary source of dispersal of ToLCPalV progenitor was estimated in Varnasi, India in 1955, from where the virus was spread. No recombination events were detected, suggesting that mutation and selection are the primary drivers of ToLCPalV evolution. Furthermore, a detailed SDT-based nucleotide sequence comparison analysis also identified two potential strains of ToLCPalV. This study elucidates the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolutionary history of ToLCPalV, revealing its cross-border spread and adaptive evolution. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of begomovirus epidemiology and provide valuable insights into ToLCPalV's phylogeography and evolutionary dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, linked closely to metabolic syndrome and rising obesity rates. Affecting up to 37% of the global adult population, MASLD prevalence is exceptionally high among individuals of Hispanic descent, with genetic factors such as the PNPLA3 gene mutation playing a significant role. The subject of this review is the traditional Mesoamerican \"milpa\" diet, which includes unprocessed local crops like maize, beans, pumpkins, chili, and tomatoes and may represent a strategy to combat MASLD. Current treatment recommendations emphasize weight loss; a reduced intake of saturated fats, processed meats, and added sugars; and increased physical activity. The milpa diet, rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, and bioactive compounds, aligns with these recommendations and could potentially mitigate MASLD by preventing liver fat accumulation and fibrosis. This narrative review focuses on available preclinical and clinical studies adopting the milpa diet as a culturally relevant, nutritious, and sustainable dietary approach in preventing and treating MASLD. More clinical studies are needed to develop precise nutritional quantitative recommendations and guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Automatic tomato disease recognition from leaf images is vital to avoid crop\nlosses by applying control measures on time. Even though recent deep\nlearning-based tomato disease recognition methods with classical training\nprocedures showed promising recognition results, they demand large labelled\ndata and involve expensive training. The traditional deep learning models\nproposed for tomato disease recognition also consume high memory and storage\nbecause of a high number of parameters. While lightweight networks overcome\nsome of these issues to a certain extent, they continue to show low performance\nand struggle to handle imbalanced data. In this paper, a novel Siamese\nnetwork-based lightweight framework is proposed for automatic tomato leaf\ndisease recognition. This framework achieves the highest accuracy of 96.97% on\nthe tomato subset obtained from the PlantVillage dataset and 95.48% on the\nTaiwan tomato leaf disease dataset. Experimental results further confirm that\nthe proposed framework is effective with imbalanced and small data. The\nbackbone deep network integrated with this framework is lightweight with\napproximately 2.9629 million trainable parameters, which is way lower than\nexisting lightweight deep networks.",

      "abstract": "Tomato leaf diseases pose a significant challenge for tomato farmers,\nresulting in substantial reductions in crop productivity. The timely and\nprecise identification of tomato leaf diseases is crucial for successfully\nimplementing disease management strategies. This paper introduces a\ntransformer-based model called TomFormer for the purpose of tomato leaf disease\ndetection. The paper's primary contributions include the following: Firstly, we\npresent a novel approach for detecting tomato leaf diseases by employing a\nfusion model that combines a visual transformer and a convolutional neural\nnetwork. Secondly, we aim to apply our proposed methodology to the Hello\nStretch robot to achieve real-time diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases. Thirdly,\nwe assessed our method by comparing it to models like YOLOS, DETR, ViT, and\nSwin, demonstrating its ability to achieve state-of-the-art outcomes. For the\npurpose of the experiment, we used three datasets of tomato leaf diseases,\nnamely KUTomaDATA, PlantDoc, and PlanVillage, where KUTomaDATA is being\ncollected from a greenhouse in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Finally, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis of the performance of our model and thoroughly discuss\nthe limitations inherent in our approach. TomFormer performed well on the\nKUTomaDATA, PlantDoc, and PlantVillage datasets, with mean average accuracy\n(mAP) scores of 87%, 81%, and 83%, respectively. The comparative results in\nterms of mAP demonstrate that our method exhibits robustness, accuracy,\nefficiency, and scalability. Furthermore, it can be readily adapted to new\ndatasets. We are confident that our work holds the potential to significantly\ninfluence the tomato industry by effectively mitigating crop losses and\nenhancing crop yields.",

      "abstract": "Tomato crop health plays a critical role in ensuring agricultural\nproductivity and food security. Timely and accurate detection of diseases\naffecting tomato plants is vital for effective disease management. In this\nstudy, we propose a deep learning-based approach for Tomato Leaf Disease\nDetection using two well-established convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nnamely VGG19 and Inception v3. The experiment is conducted on the Tomato\nVillages Dataset, encompassing images of both healthy tomato leaves and leaves\nafflicted by various diseases. The VGG19 model is augmented with fully\nconnected layers, while the Inception v3 model is modified to incorporate a\nglobal average pooling layer and a dense classification layer. Both models are\ntrained on the prepared dataset, and their performances are evaluated on a\nseparate test set. This research employs VGG19 and Inception v3 models on the\nTomato Villages dataset (4525 images) for tomato leaf disease detection. The\nmodels' accuracy of 93.93% with dropout layers demonstrates their usefulness\nfor crop health monitoring. The paper suggests a deep learning-based strategy\nthat includes normalization, resizing, dataset preparation, and unique model\narchitectures. During training, VGG19 and Inception v3 serve as feature\nextractors, with possible data augmentation and fine-tuning. Metrics like\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are obtained through evaluation on a\ntest set and offer important insights into the strengths and shortcomings of\nthe model. The method has the potential for practical use in precision\nagriculture and could help tomato crops prevent illness early on.",

The recombinant strain, designated BBG100, produced up\nto 15-fold more mycosubtilin than the wild type produced. The overproducing\nphenotype was related to enhancement of the antagonistic activities against\nseveral yeasts and pathogenic fungi. Hemolytic activities were also clearly\nincreased in the modified strain. Mass spectrometry analyses of enriched\nmycosubtilin extracts showed similar patterns of lipopeptides for BBG100 and\nthe wild type. Interestingly, these analyses also revealed a new form of\nmycosubtilin which was more easily detected in the BBG100 sample. When tested\nfor its biocontrol potential, wild-type strain ATCC 6633 was almost ineffective\nfor reducing a Pythium infection of tomato seedlings. However, treatment of\nseeds with the BBG100 overproducing strain resulted in a marked increase in the\ngermination rate of seeds. This protective effect afforded by mycosubtilin\noverproduction was also visualized by the significantly greater fresh weight of\nemerging seedlings treated with BBG100 compared to controls or seedlings\ninoculated with the wild-type strain.",

The experiments are\nbased on images collected from the internet gathered through searches using\ntomato state across diverse languages including English, German, French, and\nSpanish.

      "abstract": "Tomatoes are a major crop worldwide, and accurately classifying their\nmaturity is important for many agricultural applications, such as harvesting,\ngrading, and quality control. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method\nfor tomato maturity classification using a convolutional transformer. The\nconvolutional transformer is a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths\nof convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. Additionally, this\nstudy introduces a new tomato dataset named KUTomaData, explicitly designed to\ntrain deep-learning models for tomato segmentation and classification.\nKUTomaData is a compilation of images sourced from a greenhouse in the UAE,\nwith approximately 700 images available for training and testing. The dataset\nis prepared under various lighting conditions and viewing perspectives and\nemploys different mobile camera sensors, distinguishing it from existing\ndatasets. The contributions of this paper are threefold:Firstly, the authors\npropose a novel method for tomato maturity classification using a modular\nconvolutional transformer. Secondly, the authors introduce a new tomato image\ndataset that contains images of tomatoes at different maturity levels. Lastly,\nthe authors show that the convolutional transformer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods for tomato maturity classification. The effectiveness\nof the proposed framework in handling cluttered and occluded tomato instances\nwas evaluated using two additional public datasets, Laboro Tomato and Rob2Pheno\nAnnotated Tomato, as benchmarks. The evaluation results across these three\ndatasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed framework,\nsurpassing the state-of-the-art by 58.14%, 65.42%, and 66.39% in terms of mean\naverage precision scores for KUTomaData, Laboro Tomato, and Rob2Pheno Annotated\nTomato, respectively.",

      "abstract": "The development of an affordable and accessible vaccine platform is essential for achieving global and long-term protection against COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases. In this study, we developed a multimeric fusion protein comprising the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the β-annulus (Bann) from the tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) as a potential subunit vaccine candidate. Molecular modeling of Bann-RBD revealed a 60-mer structure with the RBD displayed on its outer surface. The Bann-RBD gene was constructed and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified Bann-RBD showed a protein band at 45 kDa, corresponding to monomeric glycosylated Bann-RBD. Peptide mapping analysis using LC-MS/MS confirmed that the expressed Bann-RBD was consistent with the designed protein fusion. The Bann-RBD protein was observed to spontaneously self-assemble into spherical nanocapsids with a diameter of approximately 50 nm. Antigenicity studies demonstrated that the purified Bann-RBD was strongly recognised by monoclonal human anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-S1 IgG antibodies. Immunogenicity studies revealed that Bann-RBD elicited a robust humoral immune response in BALB/c mice, generating potent neutralising antibodies. Collectively, these findings suggest that the recombinant Bann-RBD produced in Pichia pastoris X-33 is a promising candidate for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture plays an important role in the food and economy of Bangladesh.\nThe rapid growth of population over the years also has increased the demand for\nfood production. One of the major reasons behind low crop production is\nnumerous bacteria, virus and fungal plant diseases. Early detection of plant\ndiseases and proper usage of pesticides and fertilizers are vital for\npreventing the diseases and boost the yield. Most of the farmers use\ngeneralized pesticides and fertilizers in the entire fields without\nspecifically knowing the condition of the plants. Thus the production cost\noftentimes increases, and, not only that, sometimes this becomes detrimental to\nthe yield. Deep Learning models are found to be very effective to automatically\ndetect plant diseases from images of plants, thereby reducing the need for\nhuman specialists. This paper aims at building a lightweight deep learning\nmodel for predicting leaf disease in tomato plants. By modifying the\nregion-based convolutional neural network, we design an efficient and effective\nmodel that demonstrates satisfactory empirical performance on a benchmark\ndataset. Our proposed model can easily be deployed in a larger system where\ndrones take images of leaves and these images will be fed into our model to\nknow the health condition.",

      "abstract": "To understand why close wild plant relatives of crops, such as Solanum dulcamara, are resistant to Ralstonia solanacearum we need genome resources to perform comparative studies and identify key genes and pathways. We de-novo assembled and annotated the genome of a resistant/tolerant S. dulcamara and susceptible Solanum nigrum plant using a hybrid approach including Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina sequencing. Comparative genomic analysis was then performed to find differences between the genome of S. dulcamara and other susceptible Solanaceous species including potato, tomato, aubergine, and S. nigrum and one susceptible and one resistant S. americanum accession. We identified genes associated with auxin-transport only in S. dulcamara and a collection of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in orthogroups only found in resistant/tolerant plant species, which we hypothesise may improve recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) associated with R. solanacearum. We also identified an arsenal of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) in the S. nigrum genome that are shared with the other susceptible species and could be acting as susceptibility factors. Finally, we identified differences in methylation frequency across the gene bodies in both species, which may be associated with epigenetic regulation of resistance. Future work should assess the functional role of these PRRs and NLRs during bacterial wilt development to determine if they could offer potential novel targets for breeding to improve bacterial wilt resistance.",

      "abstract": "To sustainably meet the growing global demand for food, the conventional reliance on potentially harmful chemicals for pathogen control is transitioning to more sustainable methods that enhance plant innate immunity. Enhancing plant defenses through innovative strategies, such as utilizing antimicrobial proteins and peptides (APPs), offers an eco-friendly approach to combat significant agricultural pathogens by inducing resistance in plants. Our findings demonstrate that tomato plants treated with Solanum lycopersicum heme-binding protein 2 (SlHBP2), an apoplastic heme-binding protein with antimicrobial activity exhibited fewer disease symptoms and a lower bacterial population compared to control plants after infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst). Remarkably, SlHBP2 treatment stimulates 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) production, triggering induced systemic resistance in SlHBP2-treated plants. This systemic response boosts the overall resistance of SlHBP2-treated tomato plants to Pst by activating the antioxidant machinery. This activation results in a notable decrease in rapid reactive oxygen species (ROS) production post-inoculation by Pst. In conclusion, SlHBP2 contributes novel strategies for crop protection by enhancing OPDA-mediated defense responses, strengthening plant immunity while mitigating oxidative stress and cellular damage during Pst infection.",

      "abstract": "Tomato leaf curl Palampur virus (ToLCPalV) is an economically important bipartite begomovirus in the agro-ecological regions in south and western Asia. This study was designed to investigate the sequence variation dynamics, regional delineation, genetic diversity, population structure, and cross-border dispersal patterns of ToLCPalV. The research revealed clear geographical structuring, with distinct Indo-Pak subcontinent and Middle Eastern clades, but no host-specific differentiation. Genetic diversity analysis indicated higher diversity in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, particularly in the DNA-B component, suggesting an older, more diverse population of ToLCPalV prevailing in this region. Neutrality tests and selection pressure analyses revealed predominantly purifying selection, with limited positive selection observed in BV1 of DNA-B. The primary source of dispersal of ToLCPalV progenitor was estimated in Varnasi, India in 1955, from where the virus was spread. No recombination events were detected, suggesting that mutation and selection are the primary drivers of ToLCPalV evolution. Furthermore, a detailed SDT-based nucleotide sequence comparison analysis also identified two potential strains of ToLCPalV. This study elucidates the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolutionary history of ToLCPalV, revealing its cross-border spread and adaptive evolution. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of begomovirus epidemiology and provide valuable insights into ToLCPalV's phylogeography and evolutionary dynamics.",

      "abstract": "The development of an affordable and accessible vaccine platform is essential for achieving global and long-term protection against COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases. In this study, we developed a multimeric fusion protein comprising the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the β-annulus (Bann) from the tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) as a potential subunit vaccine candidate. Molecular modeling of Bann-RBD revealed a 60-mer structure with the RBD displayed on its outer surface. The Bann-RBD gene was constructed and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified Bann-RBD showed a protein band at 45 kDa, corresponding to monomeric glycosylated Bann-RBD. Peptide mapping analysis using LC-MS/MS confirmed that the expressed Bann-RBD was consistent with the designed protein fusion. The Bann-RBD protein was observed to spontaneously self-assemble into spherical nanocapsids with a diameter of approximately 50 nm. Antigenicity studies demonstrated that the purified Bann-RBD was strongly recognised by monoclonal human anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-S1 IgG antibodies. Immunogenicity studies revealed that Bann-RBD elicited a robust humoral immune response in BALB/c mice, generating potent neutralising antibodies. Collectively, these findings suggest that the recombinant Bann-RBD produced in Pichia pastoris X-33 is a promising candidate for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.",

      "abstract": "Plant viruses cause symptoms with devastating consequences for agriculture. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying symptom development in viral infections remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) interferes with host developmental programs through a host-mimicking domain present in the viral C4 protein. This domain mediates the interaction between C4 and a family of RCC1-like domain-containing (RLD) proteins, previously shown to be required for proper plant development and environmental responses. C4 outcompetes an endogenous interactor of RLDs, hijacking RLD proteins to the plasma membrane and disrupting their function in orchestrating endomembrane trafficking and polar auxin transport. Strikingly, symptoms do not affect viral accumulation in the plant, but serve as attractants for the insect vector, presumably promoting pathogen spread in an ecological context. Our work sheds light on the molecular underpinnings and biological relevance of symptom development triggered by TYLCV in tomato. Since most plant viruses are insect-transmitted, the principles described here might have broad applicability to crop-virus interactions.",

Artificial\nintelligence technologies combined with those of computer vision can help users\noptimize the process of monitoring the ripening status of plants. To this end,\nwe have proposed a tomato ripening monitoring approach based on deep learning\nin complex scenes. The objective is to detect mature tomatoes and harvest them\nin a timely manner. The proposed approach is declined in two parts. Firstly,\nthe images of the scene are transmitted to the pre-processing layer. This\nprocess allows the detection of areas of interest (area of the image containing\ntomatoes). Then, these images are used as input to the maturity detection\nlayer. This layer, based on a deep neural network learning algorithm,\nclassifies the tomato thumbnails provided to it in one of the following five\ncategories: green, brittle, pink, pale red, mature red. The experiments are\nbased on images collected from the internet gathered through searches using\ntomato state across diverse languages including English, German, French, and\nSpanish. The experimental results of the maturity detection layer on a dataset\ncomposed of images of tomatoes taken under the extreme conditions, gave a good\nclassification rate.",

      "abstract": "Tomatoes are a major crop worldwide, and accurately classifying their\nmaturity is important for many agricultural applications, such as harvesting,\ngrading, and quality control. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method\nfor tomato maturity classification using a convolutional transformer. The\nconvolutional transformer is a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths\nof convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. Additionally, this\nstudy introduces a new tomato dataset named KUTomaData, explicitly designed to\ntrain deep-learning models for tomato segmentation and classification.\nKUTomaData is a compilation of images sourced from a greenhouse in the UAE,\nwith approximately 700 images available for training and testing. The dataset\nis prepared under various lighting conditions and viewing perspectives and\nemploys different mobile camera sensors, distinguishing it from existing\ndatasets. The contributions of this paper are threefold:Firstly, the authors\npropose a novel method for tomato maturity classification using a modular\nconvolutional transformer. Secondly, the authors introduce a new tomato image\ndataset that contains images of tomatoes at different maturity levels. Lastly,\nthe authors show that the convolutional transformer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods for tomato maturity classification. The effectiveness\nof the proposed framework in handling cluttered and occluded tomato instances\nwas evaluated using two additional public datasets, Laboro Tomato and Rob2Pheno\nAnnotated Tomato, as benchmarks. The evaluation results across these three\ndatasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed framework,\nsurpassing the state-of-the-art by 58.14%, 65.42%, and 66.39% in terms of mean\naverage precision scores for KUTomaData, Laboro Tomato, and Rob2Pheno Annotated\nTomato, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Phytophthora infestans causes potato late blight and significantly impacts potato production. The pathogen's remarkable adaptability and ability to generate new physiological races through virulence variation undermine varietal resistance, posing challenges for disease prevention and control. To explore the genetic mechanisms behind these, different physiological races of P. infestans were inoculated on potato leaves and assayed through transcriptomics combined with metabolic profiling methods. It was found that the DL04 strain, which carries virulence factor 3, exhibited a high level of pathogenicity. Biologically, DL04 showed more rapid growth and denser mycelial structures compared to most other strains, indicating enhanced pathogenicity. DL04 induced a greater enrichment of carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways during the infection process. This led to the upregulation of genes related to cell hydrolysis, accelerating leaf infection and contributing to its higher level of pathogenicity. The reasons for the differences in pathogenicity among different physiological races of P. infestans were clarified at the transcriptional level. This finding provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of P. infestans pathogenicity and offer critical information for developing effective control strategies, breeding for disease resistance, and improving potato production practice.",

We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey between June 20 and August 31, 2022, analyzing weekly breakfast frequency, food categories, and associated factors to daily breakfast consumption using multivariable logistic regression, with subgroup analyses by gender and residence (urban or rural). Among 21,875 participants, 41.0% reported non-daily breakfast consumption. Common breakfast items included staples like rice, wheat, and corn (70.5%), eggs (56.2%), dairy products (42.0%), and soy drinks (36.8%), while less frequently consumed items included meat products (26.3%), potatoes (23.4%), fresh vegetables and fruits (20.2%), and pickled vegetables (18.2%). Behavioral factors such as sleeping 6-7 h and abstaining from smoking and sugar-sweetened beverages, along with health factors like better quality of life, family health, and higher self-efficacy, were positively associated with daily breakfast consumption. Depression was negatively associated. Sociodemographic factors including female gender, living in southern China, and having children were positively associated, whereas rural residency, higher education levels, being a student or unemployed, and living alone were negatively associated. Subgroup analyses revealed pronounced variations in breakfast habits by residence (urban vs. rural) but fewer differences by gender. Non-daily breakfast consumption is prevalent among Chinese residents, with multiple sociodemographic, behavioral, and health factors influencing this behavior. Region- and gender-specific strategies are essential to promote healthy breakfast habits, address disparities, and encourage healthier breakfast practices across diverse subgroups.",

Therefore, the use of Deep Learning for the classification process\nof potato leaf disease is expected to shorten the time and have a high\nclassification accuracy. This study uses a deep learning method with the\nDenseNet201 architecture. The choice to use the DenseNet201 algorithm in this\nstudy is because the model can identify important features of potato leaves and\nrecognize early signs of emerging diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the transfer learning method with the DenseNet201 architecture\nin increasing the classification accuracy of potato leaf disease compared to\ntraditional classification methods. This study uses two types of scenarios,\nnamely, comparing the number of dropouts and comparing the three optimizers.\nThis test produces the best model using dropout 0.1 and Adam optimizer with an\naccuracy of 99.5% for training, 95.2% for validation, and 96% for the confusion\nmatrix. In this study, using data testing, as many as 40 images were tested\ninto the model that has been built. The test results on this model resulted in\na new accuracy for classifying potato leaf disease, namely 92.5%.",

      "abstract": "The potato is a widely grown crop in many regions of the world. In recent\ndecades, potato farming has gained incredible traction in the world. Potatoes\nare susceptible to several illnesses that stunt their development. This plant\nseems to have significant leaf disease. Early Blight and Late Blight are two\nprevalent leaf diseases that affect potato plants. The early detection of these\ndiseases would be beneficial for enhancing the yield of this crop. The ideal\nsolution is to use image processing to identify and analyze these disorders.\nHere, we present an autonomous method based on image processing and machine\nlearning to detect late blight disease affecting potato leaves. The proposed\nmethod comprises four different phases: (1) Histogram Equalization is used to\nimprove the quality of the input image; (2) feature extraction is performed\nusing a Deep CNN model, then these extracted features are concatenated; (3)\nfeature selection is performed using wrapper-based feature selection; (4)\nclassification is performed using an SVM classifier and its variants. This\nproposed method achieves the highest accuracy of 99% using SVM by selecting 550\nfeatures.",

      "abstract": "Phytophthora infestans causes potato late blight and significantly impacts potato production. The pathogen's remarkable adaptability and ability to generate new physiological races through virulence variation undermine varietal resistance, posing challenges for disease prevention and control. To explore the genetic mechanisms behind these, different physiological races of P. infestans were inoculated on potato leaves and assayed through transcriptomics combined with metabolic profiling methods. It was found that the DL04 strain, which carries virulence factor 3, exhibited a high level of pathogenicity. Biologically, DL04 showed more rapid growth and denser mycelial structures compared to most other strains, indicating enhanced pathogenicity. DL04 induced a greater enrichment of carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways during the infection process. This led to the upregulation of genes related to cell hydrolysis, accelerating leaf infection and contributing to its higher level of pathogenicity. The reasons for the differences in pathogenicity among different physiological races of P. infestans were clarified at the transcriptional level. This finding provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of P. infestans pathogenicity and offer critical information for developing effective control strategies, breeding for disease resistance, and improving potato production practice.",

      "abstract": "Manual tissue extraction from potato tubers for molecular pathogen detection\nis highly laborious. This study presents a machine-vision-guided, dual-arm\ncoordinated inline robotic system integrating tuber grasping and tissue\nsampling mechanisms. Tubers are transported on a conveyor that halts when a\nYOLOv11-based vision system detects a tuber within the workspace of a\none-prismatic-degree-of-freedom (P-DoF) robotic arm. This arm, equipped with a\ngripping end-effector, secures and positions the tuber for sampling. The second\narm, a 3-P-DoF Cartesian manipulator with a biopsy punch-based end-effector,\nthen performs tissue extraction guided by a YOLOv10-based vision system that\nidentifies the sampling sites on the tuber such as eyes or stolon scars. The\nsampling involves four stages: insertion of the punch into the tuber, punch\nrotation for tissue detachment, biopsy punch retraction, and deposition of the\ntissue core onto a collection site. The system achieved an average positional\nerror of 1.84 mm along the tuber surface and a depth deviation of 1.79 mm from\na 7.00 mm target. The success rate for core extraction and deposition was\n81.5%, with an average sampling cycle of 10.4 seconds. The total cost of the\nsystem components was under $1,900, demonstrating the system's potential as a\ncost-effective alternative to labor-intensive manual tissue sampling. Future\nwork will focus on optimizing for multi-site sampling from a single tuber and\nvalidation in commercial settings.",

      "abstract": "Effect of storage temperatures and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on the shelf-life and spoilage microbial dynamics of industrially produced mayonnaise-based potato salad was studied over two years (Spring 2021, Autumn 2021, Spring 2022). Three salad batches, stored at chilling and abuse temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 12 °C, were analyzed. Microbial communities were evaluated using ISO-standard microbiological methods, MALDI-TOF MS identification, and PacBio full-length 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing. The results showed that sensory and microbiological quality strongly depended on storage temperature, MAP packaging, and salad batch. The recommended upper temperature limit of 6 °C did not preserve salad quality at the end of its shelf-life, while storage below 4 °C extended the seven-day shelf-life to 10 days. Distinct spoilage communities were identified across batches, dominated by Dellaglioa algida, Leuconostoc carnosum, and Latilactobacillus sakei (Spring 2021); Leuconostoc inhae and Leuconostoc gelidum (Autumn 2021); and Lactococcus carnosus (Spring 2022). The microbial communities of ingredients and processing facilities influenced salad microbiota. Comparative analysis showed that full-length 16S rRNA sequencing provided higher resolution, detecting species missed by culturing methods, including psychrotrophic and fastidious lactic acid bacteria. However, fungal community analysis, using full-length ITS amplicons, requires the selection of specific fungal primers. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of microbial profiles in RTE salads under different storage conditions, highlighting the critical role of temperature and microbial management in preserving MAP salad safety and quality during extended shelf-life.",

This\nmodel demonstrates that increased variability in moisture (both short-term and\nlong-term) increases biodiversity and that fungal populations will shift\ntowards more stress-tolerant fungi as aridity increases. The model further\nsuggests the lack of any direct link between biodiversity and decomposition\nrates.\n  To better describe fungal competition with respect to space, we develop a\nlocal agent-based model (ABM). Unlike the previous model, our ABM focuses on\nindividuals, tracking each fungus and the result of its interactions. Our ABM\nalso features a more accurate spatial combat system, allowing us to precisely\ndiscern the influence of fungal interactions on the environment. This model\ncorroborates the results of the differential equation model and further\nsuggests that moisture, through its link with temperature and effects on fungal\npopulation, also plays a strong role in determining fungal decomposition rates.\n  Together, these models suggest that climate change, which portends increasing\nvariability in regional conditions and higher average temperatures worldwide,\nwill lead to an increase in both wood decomposition rates and, independently,\nfungal biodiversity.",

Genetically engineered luminescent bacterial strains were used to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by crops during spoilage. Key factors investigated include bacterial uniformity, nutrient supply, and temperature effects. The results demonstrated that lower temperatures (+4 °C) yielded higher sensor sensitivity and prolonged bacterial viability. A proof-of-concept evaluation was conducted in storage-like conditions, showing effective infection detection in potatoes. These findings underscore the potential of whole-cell-based biosensors for monitoring postharvest production in cold storage environments.",

      "abstract": "Disease suppressiveness is a complex phenomenon that is assumed to be the resultant of the actions of local microbial antagonists. Exploitation of disease suppressiveness as a tool to manage pathogens is hindered by our poor understanding of this phenomenon. Here we investigated soil microbiome-based suppression of potato cyst nematodes (PCN), and to this end, four apparently homogeneous potato fields with an unexplained non-homogeneous PCN distribution were selected. We hypothesised that this patchy PCN distribution resulted from local variation in disease suppressiveness. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, we confirmed the overall suppressiveness of these soils vis-à-vis PCN and soils were gamma-irradiated to corroborate the biotic origin of this suppression. Subsequent DNA-based analysis of the microbial community in the potato rhizosphere revealed suppressiveness-related contrasts in community composition between suppressive and conducive patches. Elevated abundances of fungal (e.g., Metacordyceps chlamydosporia) and bacterial (e.g., Pseudomonas fluorescens) nematode antagonists were positively associated with PCN suppressive patches. Distinct sets of antagonists were found to be associated with PCN suppression despite the geographical closeness of the locations under investigation. Our findings confirm the biotic origin of local PCN suppressiveness and reveal that disparate microbial communities could achieve similar outcomes.",

      "abstract": "To understand why close wild plant relatives of crops, such as Solanum dulcamara, are resistant to Ralstonia solanacearum we need genome resources to perform comparative studies and identify key genes and pathways. We de-novo assembled and annotated the genome of a resistant/tolerant S. dulcamara and susceptible Solanum nigrum plant using a hybrid approach including Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina sequencing. Comparative genomic analysis was then performed to find differences between the genome of S. dulcamara and other susceptible Solanaceous species including potato, tomato, aubergine, and S. nigrum and one susceptible and one resistant S. americanum accession. We identified genes associated with auxin-transport only in S. dulcamara and a collection of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in orthogroups only found in resistant/tolerant plant species, which we hypothesise may improve recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) associated with R. solanacearum. We also identified an arsenal of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) in the S. nigrum genome that are shared with the other susceptible species and could be acting as susceptibility factors. Finally, we identified differences in methylation frequency across the gene bodies in both species, which may be associated with epigenetic regulation of resistance. Future work should assess the functional role of these PRRs and NLRs during bacterial wilt development to determine if they could offer potential novel targets for breeding to improve bacterial wilt resistance.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies suggest that virus infections can improve drought resistance in host plants, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Potato virus Y (PVY), Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and the host Nicotiana benthamiana as model systems to investigate these mechanisms. Our findings reveal that the abscisic acid (ABA) signalling pathway is strongly and durably induced by +RNA virus infection and is essential for virus-induced drought tolerance. Notably, although ABA content increased following virus infection, this elevation was not necessary for downstream ABA signalling or virus-induced drought tolerance. Instead, +RNA virus-induced drought tolerance relies on N. benthamiana phospholipase Dα1 (NbPLDα1)-derived phosphatidic acid (PA). Knockout of NbPLDα1 or disruption of the interaction between viral proteins and NbPLDα1 impaired the ability of +RNA viruses to activate ABA signalling and enhance drought tolerance. The virus-induced increase in ABA levels appears to result from feedback regulation by PA-activated ABA signalling. Overall, our results suggest that +RNA viruses improve plant drought tolerance by modulating NbPLDα1-derived PA rather than by promoting ABA production.",

Histological observations revealed that E. coli, L. monocytogenes, and MNV could penetrate potato tissues through the periderm cells, apoplast, and xylem, particularly in damaged potatoes, causing browning, lignification, and biofilm formation. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed the internalization of pathogens: E. coli, L. monocytogenes, and MNV were detected at levels 1 log genome copy higher in damaged potatoes, respectively. This study also demonstrated hyperplastic activity in the phellogen layer in response to bacteria and viruses.

To assess the long-term impact of different fungicidal mechanisms on the sensitivity of FHB pathogens, this study evaluated temporal changes in the sensitivity of Fusarium asiaticum to phenamacril (a novel cyanoacrylate fungicide) and tebuconazole (a DMI fungicide). Sensitivity was determined by measuring mycelial growth inhibition in F. asiaticum field populations collected in 2008 (100 strains), 2021 (50 strains), and 2023 (50 strains) from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces of China, where FHB pressure and fungicide usage are high. A significant decline in F. asiaticum sensitivity to phenamacril over 15 years was observed, with EC50 values nearly doubling between 2008 and 2023. In contrast, no notable change in sensitivity to tebuconazole was observed over the same period, indicating its stable inhibitory effect on F. asiaticum.

Wheat is one of the most important\nfood resources in the world, mainly because of the variety of wheat-based\nproducts. Wheat crops are threatened by three main types of diseases which\ncause large amounts of annual damage in crop yield. These diseases can be\neliminated by using pesticides at the right time. While the task of manually\nspraying pesticides is burdensome and expensive, agricultural robotics can aid\nfarmers by increasing the speed and decreasing the amount of chemicals. In this\nwork, a smart autonomous system has been implemented on an unmanned aerial\nvehicle to automate the task of monitoring wheat fields. First, an image-based\ndeep learning approach is used to detect and classify disease-infected wheat\nplants. To find the most optimal method, different approaches have been\nstudied. Because of the lack of a public wheat-disease dataset, a custom\ndataset has been created and labeled. Second, an efficient mapping and\nnavigation system is presented using a simulation in the robot operating system\nand Gazebo environments.

Monitoring for health status of\ncrops is critical to control the spread of diseases and implement effective\nmanagement. This paper presents an in-field automatic wheat disease diagnosis\nsystem based on a weakly super- vised deep learning framework, i.e. deep\nmultiple instance learning, which achieves an integration of identification for\nwheat diseases and localization for disease areas with only image-level\nannotation for training images in wild conditions. Furthermore, a new in-field\nimage dataset for wheat disease, Wheat Disease Database 2017 (WDD2017), is\ncollected to verify the effectiveness of our system. Under two different\narchitectures, i.e. VGG-FCN-VD16 and VGG-FCN-S, our system achieves the mean\nrecognition accuracies of 97.95% and 95.12% respectively over 5-fold\ncross-validation on WDD2017, exceeding the results of 93.27% and 73.00% by two\nconventional CNN frameworks, i.e. VGG-CNN-VD16 and VGG-CNN-S. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms conventional CNN\narchitectures on recognition accuracy under the same amount of parameters,\nmeanwhile main- taining accurate localization for corresponding disease areas.\nMoreover, the proposed system has been packed into a real-time mobile app to\nprovide support for agricultural disease diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Wheat yellow rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis, is a critical\ndisease affecting wheat crops across Britain, leading to significant yield\nlosses and economic consequences. Given the rapid environmental changes and the\nevolving virulence of pathogens, there is a growing need for innovative\napproaches to predict and manage such diseases over the long term. This study\nexplores the feasibility of using deep learning models to predict outbreaks of\nwheat yellow rust in British fields, offering a proactive approach to disease\nmanagement. We construct a yellow rust dataset with historial weather\ninformation and disease indicator acrossing multiple regions in England. We\nemploy two poweful deep learning models, including fully connected neural\nnetworks and long short-term memory to develop predictive models capable of\nrecognizing patterns and predicting future disease outbreaks.The models are\ntrained and validated in a randomly sliced datasets. The performance of these\nmodels with different predictive time steps are evaluated based on their\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Preliminary results indicate that\ndeep learning models can effectively capture the complex interactions between\nmultiple factors influencing disease dynamics, demonstrating a promising\ncapacity to forecast wheat yellow rust with considerable accuracy.\nSpecifically, the fully-connected neural network achieved 83.65% accuracy in a\ndisease prediction task with 6 month predictive time step setup. These findings\nhighlight the potential of deep learning to transform disease management\nstrategies, enabling earlier and more precise interventions. Our study provides\na methodological framework for employing deep learning in agricultural settings\nbut also opens avenues for future research to enhance the robustness and\napplicability of predictive models in combating crop diseases globally.",

      "title": "The effect of spatial scales on the reproductive fitness of plant\n  pathogens",
      "abstract": "Plant diseases often cause serious yield losses in agriculture. A pathogen's\nreproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.\nSince pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial\nseparation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of\npathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic\nreproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field\nsizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a\nmaximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This\npattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that\ndecrease exponentially or faster as well as for \"fat-tailed\" dispersal kernels\nthat decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this\napproach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by\nPuccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were\nthoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,\n95, 983 (2005)]. For the two largest datasets, we estimated R0 in the limit of\nlarge fields to be of the order of 50. These estimates are consistent with\nindependent field observations [Cowger et al. (2005), Phytopathology, 95,\n97282; Farber et al. (2013), Phytopathology, 103, 41]. We present a proof of\nprinciple of a novel approach to estimate the basic reproductive number, R0, of\nplant pathogens using wheat stripe rust as a case study. We found that the\nspatial extent over which R0 changes strongly is quite fine-scaled (about 30 m\nof the linear extension of the field). Our results indicate that in order to\noptimize the spatial scale of deployment of fungicides or host resistances, the\nadjustments should be made at a fine spatial scale.",

      "abstract": "Wheat is one of the major staple crops across the globe. Therefore, it is\nmandatory to measure, maintain and improve the wheat quality for human\nconsumption. Traditional wheat quality measurement methods are mostly invasive,\ndestructive and limited to small samples of wheat. In a typical supply chain of\nwheat, there are many receival points where bulk wheat arrives, gets stored and\nforwarded as per the requirements. In this receival points, the application of\ntraditional quality measurement methods is difficult and often very expensive.\nTherefore, there is a need for non-invasive, non-destructive real-time methods\nfor wheat quality assessments. One such method that fulfils the above-mentioned\ncriteria is hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for food quality measurement and it can\nalso be applied to bulk samples. In this paper, we have investigated how HSI\nhas been used in the literature for assessing stored wheat quality. So that the\nrequired information to implement real-time digital quality assessment methods\nat the different stages of Australian supply chain can be made available in a\nsingle and compact document.",

      "abstract": "The wheat stem rust pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) causes severe crop losses worldwide. Several stem rust resistance (Sr) genes exhibit temperature-dependent immune responses. Sr6-mediated resistance is enhanced at lower temperatures, whereas Sr13 and Sr21 resistances are enhanced at higher temperatures. Here, we clone Sr6 using mutagenesis and resistance gene enrichment and sequencing (MutRenSeq), identifying it to encode a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein with an integrated BED domain. Sr6 temperature sensitivity is also transferred to wheat plants transformed with the Sr6 gene. Differential gene expression analysis of near-isogenic lines inoculated with Pgt at varying temperatures reveals that genes upregulated in the low-temperature-effective Sr6 response differ from those upregulated in the high-temperature-effective responses associated with Sr13 and Sr21. These findings highlight divergent molecular pathways involved in temperature-sensitive immunity and inform future strategies for deployment and engineering of genetic resistance in response to a changing climate.",

      "abstract": "Fusarium head blight (FHB), one of the most economically important diseases on wheat, is primarily managed through the application of chemical fungicide during the heading and flowering stages. To assess the long-term impact of different fungicidal mechanisms on the sensitivity of FHB pathogens, this study evaluated temporal changes in the sensitivity of Fusarium asiaticum to phenamacril (a novel cyanoacrylate fungicide) and tebuconazole (a DMI fungicide). Sensitivity was determined by measuring mycelial growth inhibition in F. asiaticum field populations collected in 2008 (100 strains), 2021 (50 strains), and 2023 (50 strains) from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces of China, where FHB pressure and fungicide usage are high. A significant decline in F. asiaticum sensitivity to phenamacril over 15 years was observed, with EC50 values nearly doubling between 2008 and 2023. In contrast, no notable change in sensitivity to tebuconazole was observed over the same period, indicating its stable inhibitory effect on F. asiaticum. These findings highlight the challenge of F. asiaticum adaptation to phenamacril, posing a significant concern for the long-term management of FHB in wheat cultivation.",

Effective\nmonitoring and accurate detection of FHB are crucial to ensuring stable and\nreliable food security.

      "abstract": "As the impending consequences of climate change loom over the Earth, it has\nbecome vital for researchers to understand the role microorganisms play in this\nprocess. In this paper, we examine how environmental factors, including\nmoisture levels and temperature, affect the expression of certain fungal\ncharacteristics on a microscale, and how these in turn affect fungal\nbiodiversity and ecosystem decomposition rates over time.\n  We first present a differential equation model to understand how the\ndistribution of different fungal isolates depends on regional moisture levels.\nWe introduce both slow and sudden variations into the environment in order to\nrepresent the various ways climate change will impact fungal ecosystems. This\nmodel demonstrates that increased variability in moisture (both short-term and\nlong-term) increases biodiversity and that fungal populations will shift\ntowards more stress-tolerant fungi as aridity increases. The model further\nsuggests the lack of any direct link between biodiversity and decomposition\nrates.\n  To better describe fungal competition with respect to space, we develop a\nlocal agent-based model (ABM). Unlike the previous model, our ABM focuses on\nindividuals, tracking each fungus and the result of its interactions. Our ABM\nalso features a more accurate spatial combat system, allowing us to precisely\ndiscern the influence of fungal interactions on the environment. This model\ncorroborates the results of the differential equation model and further\nsuggests that moisture, through its link with temperature and effects on fungal\npopulation, also plays a strong role in determining fungal decomposition rates.\n  Together, these models suggest that climate change, which portends increasing\nvariability in regional conditions and higher average temperatures worldwide,\nwill lead to an increase in both wood decomposition rates and, independently,\nfungal biodiversity.",

This study aimed to biosynthesize zinc oxide NPs (ZnONPs) from the plant species Aloe vera L., Peganum harmala L., Retama monosperma L., and Thymelaea hirsuta L. The biosynthesized ZnONPs were referred to as \"Thymhirs.bio-ZnONP,\" \"Aloever.bio-ZnONP,\" \"Retam.bio-ZnONP,\" and \"Harm.bio-ZnONP.\" A UV-visible spectrophotometer, granulometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance were used for physicochemical characterization. Pharmacokinetics and antimicrobial effects were explored using combined in vitro and computational assays. An abundance of phenolic acids and flavonoids was observed, particularly rutin, quinic acid, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, and cirsiliol, which may act as reducing, stabilizing, and capping agents in the biosynthesis. ZnONPs demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity against various bacterial, fungal, and yeast strains, highlighting their potential medicinal applications. This inhibitory activity can be attributed to the effect of the plant-based ZnO nanosized particles more than to the plant extracts or Zn salt. Computational modeling revealed that the identified phytochemicals (phenolic acids and flavonoids) bound Tyrosyl-tRNA Synthetase (TyrRS) from S. aureus (1JIJ), aspartic proteinase from C. albicans (2QZW), and wheat germ agglutinin (2UVO) with considerable affinities, which, together with molecular interactions and pharmacokinetics, satisfactorily support the in vitro antimicrobial findings.

      "abstract": "1- This work emphasises the potential of Co@Ag-NPs as an efficient antimicrobial agent. The scientific community has recently shown silver nanohybrids to maintain plural consistency and their potential applications in wastewater treatment. Where these nanohybrids showed highly removing capacity of the three main contaminants (pesticides, microorganisms, and heavy metals) from waste water. The ability of silver and cobalt nanohybrids to inhibit bacteria and fungi that cause illnesses both in vitro and in vivo has made them an outstanding antimicrobial agent. Cobalt-silver nanohybrid particles (Co@AgNPs) have antibacterial properties against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including those that are resistant to multiple drugs. Co@AgNPs have several simultaneous modes of action, and when combined with organic chemicals or medicines that fight bacteria, they have demonstrated a synergistic effect on infections. Because of their unique properties, silver and cobalt nanohybrids can be used in medical and healthcare goods to effectively treat or prevent infections. The preparation and characterization of highly stable cobalt silver nanohybrid (Co@Ag) have been reported. Out of the water samples, four bacterial and seven fungal isolates are identified. Various concentrations of Co@Ag, ranging from 10",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in functional foods in recent years to improve health and boost immunity, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, which reflects their significant role in promoting health and preventing various diseases, especially metabolic disorders. This study investigated the antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticoagulant, and prebiotic activities of six different oils: Calotropis procera oil (CPO), Chia seed oil (CSO), Moringa oil (MO), Neem oil (NO), Black seed oil (BSO), and Wheat germ oil (WGO) and their potential applications in health and nutrition. The DPPH and ABTS assays were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of these oils. A good diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) method were used to investigate the antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi of human interest. Also, the prebiotic activities of oils were tested on three probiotic strains of Lactobacillus to evaluate their role in promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria against the pathogenic E. coli. Furthermore, the haematological effect of these oils was investigated in vitro through measuring their anticoagulant, and Fibrinolytic activity. The results demonstrated that DPPH assay revealed that CPO and WGO exhibited the highest antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 15.2 µg/mL and 18.7 µg/mL, respectively, while BSO showed the least activity with an IC50 of 45.3 µg/mL. Antimicrobial activity, assessed using inhibition zone diameters, showed that CPO had the strongest effect against Staphylococcus aureus with a zone of 22 mm, followed by CSO at 19 mm. In terms of anticoagulant activity, CSO demonstrated the most potent fibrinolytic effect with a clot lysis percentage of 78%, while MO exhibited weaker activity at 35%. Prebiotic testing revealed that individual oils had limited effects on Lactobacillus growth, but a synergistic blend enhanced growth by 25% compared to controls. Overall, this study highlights the diverse health benefits of these oils and their potential as functional food ingredients that could contribute to improved health.",

      "title": "Viral Challenges in Wheat: Comprehensive Diagnosis and Innovative Management Approaches.",
      "abstract": "Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a staple crop cultivated globally, providing essential nutrition to billions. However, viral diseases pose a major challenge, causing yield losses of up to 80% and significant economic damage. More than 50 distinct viruses infect wheat, with key threats including wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs), high plains wheat mosaic virus (HPWMoV), soilborne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV), and wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV). These viruses are primarily transmitted by vectors such as wheat curl mites (Aceria tosichella), aphids, and soilborne fungi like Polymyxa graminis. Diagnosing wheat viral infections is challenging due to overlapping symptoms with other plant stresses and the microscopic nature of viruses. Recent advancements in molecular and serological diagnostics, including Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), RT-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), CRISPR-based detection, and biosensors, have improved virus identification and monitoring. Since chemical treatments are ineffective, integrated management strategies such as breeding virus-resistant varieties, controlling vector populations, adjusting cultural practices, and utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) are essential for mitigating disease spread. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of wheat viral diseases, focusing on cutting-edge diagnostic tools and sustainable management approaches. By addressing knowledge gaps and highlighting future research directions, it aims to support the development of virus-resistant wheat, ensuring global food security.",

Metagenomics allows studying taxa that are often overlooked in microbiota studies, such as protists or viruses. Here, we employed metagenomics to characterise microbial successions after wheat straw input in a 4-month in-situ field study. We compared microbial successions patterns with those obtained by high throughput amplicon sequencing on the same soil samples to validate metagenomics as a tool for the fine analysis of microbial population dynamics in situ. Taxonomic patterns were concordant between the two methodologies but metagenomics allowed studying all the microbial groups simultaneously. Notably, our results evidenced that each domain displayed a specific dynamic pattern after wheat straw amendment. For instance, viral sequences multiplied in the early phase of straw decomposition, in parallel to copiotrophic bacteria, suggesting a \"kill-the-winner\" pattern that, to our knowledge, had not been observed before in soil. Altogether, our results highlighted that both inter and intra-domain trophic interactions were impacted by wheat amendment and these patterns depended on the land use history. Our study highlights that top-down regulation by microbial predators or viruses might play a key role in soil microbiota dynamics and structure.",

This review systematically examines its bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, terpenoids, and sterols, which contribute to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and metabolic regulatory effects. These properties support its potential therapeutic applications in aging-related conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's), cardiovascular disorders, metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes and obesity), and kidney dysfunction. Preclinical studies highlight corn silk's role in mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation-key drivers of aging. Additionally, preliminary clinical trials, particularly on its anti-diabetic effects, show promise, but larger randomized controlled trials are needed to establish its safety and efficacy. Future research should focus on standardizing extraction methods, elucidating mechanisms of action, and exploring synergistic interactions among its bioactive constituents. Together, this review emphasizes the need for continued investigation into corn silk as a natural, multi-target therapeutic agent for aging and age-related diseases, and advancing its potential for clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Southern corn rust, caused by Puccinia polysora Underw., is one of the worldwide maize disease. With the change of global climate and farming system, southern corn rust has become one of the major diseases that seriously threaten the safety of maize production in China. The disease is air-borne, and presents the regional epidemic characteristics in China; however, its population structure in different regions is still unclear. In this study, we used High-throughput sequencing techniques with a Genotyping-by-Sequencing approach to study the population structure of P. polysora in the pathogen's winter-reproductive regions. Population genetic analysis indicated that the P. polysora isolates from Ledong, Hainan, collected in July, formed a distinct genetic group, indicating seasonal genetic differentiation within this region. However, the remaining isolates from Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi were clustered into two main genetic groups, with no significant genetic differentiation detected among the populations from these three provinces. This suggests frequent genetic exchange among P. polysora populations in Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, leading to overall genetic homogeneity. These findings underscore the role of genetic connectivity in shaping the population structure of P. polysora in the pathogen's winter-reproductive regions, offering novel insights into its genetic dynamics. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information to support the development of effective strategies for managing P. polysora in China.",

      "abstract": "While the importance of breakfast for human health is widely acknowledged, there is limited understanding of the factors influencing breakfast habits among Chinese residents. We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey between June 20 and August 31, 2022, analyzing weekly breakfast frequency, food categories, and associated factors to daily breakfast consumption using multivariable logistic regression, with subgroup analyses by gender and residence (urban or rural). Among 21,875 participants, 41.0% reported non-daily breakfast consumption. Common breakfast items included staples like rice, wheat, and corn (70.5%), eggs (56.2%), dairy products (42.0%), and soy drinks (36.8%), while less frequently consumed items included meat products (26.3%), potatoes (23.4%), fresh vegetables and fruits (20.2%), and pickled vegetables (18.2%). Behavioral factors such as sleeping 6-7 h and abstaining from smoking and sugar-sweetened beverages, along with health factors like better quality of life, family health, and higher self-efficacy, were positively associated with daily breakfast consumption. Depression was negatively associated. Sociodemographic factors including female gender, living in southern China, and having children were positively associated, whereas rural residency, higher education levels, being a student or unemployed, and living alone were negatively associated. Subgroup analyses revealed pronounced variations in breakfast habits by residence (urban vs. rural) but fewer differences by gender. Non-daily breakfast consumption is prevalent among Chinese residents, with multiple sociodemographic, behavioral, and health factors influencing this behavior. Region- and gender-specific strategies are essential to promote healthy breakfast habits, address disparities, and encourage healthier breakfast practices across diverse subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Accurate disease identification and its severity estimation is an important\nconsideration for disease management. Deep learning-based solutions for disease\nmanagement using imagery datasets are being increasingly explored by the\nresearch community. However, most reported studies have relied on imagery\ndatasets that were acquired under controlled lab conditions. As a result, such\nmodels lacked the ability to identify diseases in the field. Therefore, to\ntrain a robust deep learning model for field use, an imagery dataset was\ncreated using raw images acquired under field conditions using a handheld\nsensor and augmented images with varying backgrounds. The Corn Disease and\nSeverity (CD&S) dataset consisted of 511, 524, and 562, field acquired raw\nimages, corresponding to three common foliar corn diseases, namely Northern\nLeaf Blight (NLB), Gray Leaf Spot (GLS), and Northern Leaf Spot (NLS),\nrespectively. For training disease identification models, half of the imagery\ndata for each disease was annotated using bounding boxes and also used to\ngenerate 2343 additional images through augmentation using three different\nbackgrounds. For severity estimation, an additional 515 raw images for NLS were\nacquired and categorized into severity classes ranging from 1 (resistant) to 5\n(susceptible).

      "abstract": "A disease that limits a plant from its maximal capacity is defined as plant\ndisease. From the perspective of agriculture, diagnosing plant disease is\ncrucial, as diseases often limit plants' production capacity. However, manual\napproaches to recognize plant diseases are often temporal, challenging, and\ntime-consuming. Therefore, computerized recognition of plant diseases is highly\ndesired in the field of agricultural automation. Due to the recent improvement\nof computer vision, identifying diseases using leaf images of a particular\nplant has already been introduced. Nevertheless, the most introduced model can\nonly diagnose diseases of a specific plant. Hence, in this chapter, we\ninvestigate an optimal plant disease identification model combining the\ndiagnosis of multiple plants. Despite relying on multi-class classification,\nthe model inherits a multilabel classification method to identify the plant and\nthe type of disease in parallel. For the experiment and evaluation, we\ncollected data from various online sources that included leaf images of six\nplants, including tomato, potato, rice, corn, grape, and apple. In our\ninvestigation, we implement numerous popular convolutional neural network (CNN)\narchitectures. The experimental results validate that the Xception and DenseNet\narchitectures perform better in multi-label plant disease classification tasks.\nThrough architectural investigation, we imply that skip connections, spatial\nconvolutions, and shorter hidden layer connectivity cause better results in\nplant disease classification.",

      "abstract": "Southern corn rust, caused by Puccinia polysora Underw., is one of the worldwide maize disease. With the change of global climate and farming system, southern corn rust has become one of the major diseases that seriously threaten the safety of maize production in China. The disease is air-borne, and presents the regional epidemic characteristics in China; however, its population structure in different regions is still unclear. In this study, we used High-throughput sequencing techniques with a Genotyping-by-Sequencing approach to study the population structure of P. polysora in the pathogen's winter-reproductive regions. Population genetic analysis indicated that the P. polysora isolates from Ledong, Hainan, collected in July, formed a distinct genetic group, indicating seasonal genetic differentiation within this region. However, the remaining isolates from Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi were clustered into two main genetic groups, with no significant genetic differentiation detected among the populations from these three provinces. This suggests frequent genetic exchange among P. polysora populations in Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, leading to overall genetic homogeneity. These findings underscore the role of genetic connectivity in shaping the population structure of P. polysora in the pathogen's winter-reproductive regions, offering novel insights into its genetic dynamics. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information to support the development of effective strategies for managing P. polysora in China.",

The PAF describes the attributable risk\ndue to an exposure and is often interpreted as the proportion of preventable\ncases if the exposure could be extinct. Difficulties in the definition and\ninterpretation of the PAF arise when the exposure of interest depends on time.\nThen, the definition of exposed and unexposed individuals is not\nstraightforward. We propose dynamic prediction and landmarking to define and\nestimate a PAF in this data situation.

Considering the first estimand, at each landmark the estimation\nproblem is reduced to a time-independent setting. Then, estimation is simply\nperformed by using a generalized-linear model accounting for the current\nexposure state and further (time-varying) covariates. The second estimand is\nbased on counterfactual outcomes, estimation can be performed using\npseudo-values or inverse-probability weights. The approach is explored in a\nsimulation study and applied on two data examples. First, we study a large\nFrench database of intensive care unit patients to estimate the\npopulation-benefit of a pathogen-specific intervention that could prevent\nventilator-associated pneumonia caused by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nMoreover, we quantify the population-attributable burden of locoregional and\ndistant recurrence in breast cancer patients.",

Aerosols that hold\nmore than one pathogen copy, i.e. poly-pathogen aerosols, break this assumption\neven if the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. For the largest\naerosols where the number of pathogen in each aerosol can sometimes be several\nhundred or several thousand, the effect is non-negligible, especially in\ndiseases where the risk of infection per pathogen is high. Here we report on a\ngeneralization of the Wells-Riley model and dose-response models for\npoly-pathogen aerosols by separately modeling each number of pathogen copies\nper aerosol, while the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. This\nresults in a model for computational risk assessment suitable for\nmono-/poly-pathogen aerosols. We show that the mono-pathogen assumption\nsignificantly overestimates the risk of infection for high pathogen\nconcentrations in the respiratory tract fluid. The model also includes the\naerosol removal due to filtering by the individuals which becomes significant\nfor poorly ventilated environments with a high density of individuals, and\nsystematically includes the effects of facemasks in the infectious aerosol\nsource and sink terms and dose calculations.",

      "abstract": "Southern corn rust, caused by Puccinia polysora Underw., is one of the worldwide maize disease. With the change of global climate and farming system, southern corn rust has become one of the major diseases that seriously threaten the safety of maize production in China. The disease is air-borne, and presents the regional epidemic characteristics in China; however, its population structure in different regions is still unclear. In this study, we used High-throughput sequencing techniques with a Genotyping-by-Sequencing approach to study the population structure of P. polysora in the pathogen's winter-reproductive regions. Population genetic analysis indicated that the P. polysora isolates from Ledong, Hainan, collected in July, formed a distinct genetic group, indicating seasonal genetic differentiation within this region. However, the remaining isolates from Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi were clustered into two main genetic groups, with no significant genetic differentiation detected among the populations from these three provinces. This suggests frequent genetic exchange among P. polysora populations in Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, leading to overall genetic homogeneity. These findings underscore the role of genetic connectivity in shaping the population structure of P. polysora in the pathogen's winter-reproductive regions, offering novel insights into its genetic dynamics. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information to support the development of effective strategies for managing P. polysora in China.",

Tar spot has proven to be an\nimpactful disease in terms of reducing crop yield. To quantify disease\nprogression, experts usually have to visually phenotype leaves from the plant.\nThis process is very time-consuming and is difficult to incorporate in any\nhigh-throughput phenotyping system. Deep neural networks could provide quick,\nautomated tar spot detection with sufficient ground truth. However, manually\nlabeling tar spots in images to serve as ground truth is also tedious and\ntime-consuming. In this paper we first describe an approach that uses automated\nimage analysis tools to generate ground truth images that are then used for\ntraining a Mask R-CNN. We show that a Mask R-CNN can be used effectively to\ndetect tar spots in close-up images of leaf surfaces. We additionally show that\nthe Mask R-CNN can also be used for in-field images of whole leaves to capture\nthe number of tar spots and area of the leaf infected by the disease.",

Effective\nmonitoring and accurate detection of FHB are crucial to ensuring stable and\nreliable food security.

In this study,\nwe propose a self-unsupervised classification method based on HSI endmember\nextraction strategy and top-K bands selection, designed to analyze material\nsignatures in HSIs to derive discriminative feature representations.

      "abstract": "As the impending consequences of climate change loom over the Earth, it has\nbecome vital for researchers to understand the role microorganisms play in this\nprocess. In this paper, we examine how environmental factors, including\nmoisture levels and temperature, affect the expression of certain fungal\ncharacteristics on a microscale, and how these in turn affect fungal\nbiodiversity and ecosystem decomposition rates over time.\n  We first present a differential equation model to understand how the\ndistribution of different fungal isolates depends on regional moisture levels.\nWe introduce both slow and sudden variations into the environment in order to\nrepresent the various ways climate change will impact fungal ecosystems. This\nmodel demonstrates that increased variability in moisture (both short-term and\nlong-term) increases biodiversity and that fungal populations will shift\ntowards more stress-tolerant fungi as aridity increases. The model further\nsuggests the lack of any direct link between biodiversity and decomposition\nrates.\n  To better describe fungal competition with respect to space, we develop a\nlocal agent-based model (ABM). Unlike the previous model, our ABM focuses on\nindividuals, tracking each fungus and the result of its interactions. Our ABM\nalso features a more accurate spatial combat system, allowing us to precisely\ndiscern the influence of fungal interactions on the environment. This model\ncorroborates the results of the differential equation model and further\nsuggests that moisture, through its link with temperature and effects on fungal\npopulation, also plays a strong role in determining fungal decomposition rates.\n  Together, these models suggest that climate change, which portends increasing\nvariability in regional conditions and higher average temperatures worldwide,\nwill lead to an increase in both wood decomposition rates and, independently,\nfungal biodiversity.",

      "title": "First Report on Wheat Dwarf India Virus Infecting Maize (",
      "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays) is among the most extensively cultivated crops in China, serving as a crucial source of food, feed, and biofuel. Viral diseases, such as maize lethal necrosis, contribute significantly to corn yield losses (Mahuku et al. 2015; Jiao et al. 2022). In 2022, an infected maize plant exhibiting virus-like symptoms, including yellowing and dwarfing, was observed in Hainan, China (Supplementary Figure S1). To identify the pathogen responsible, leaf tissues were collected and their total RNA was extracted and assessed for quality. Then the plant was tested by RT-PCR for the following six viruses reported in China causing yellowing and/or dwarfing, including sugarcane mosaic virus, barley yellow dwarf virus, maize yellow mosaic virus, southern rice black streaked dwarf virus, maize chlorotic mottle virus and sorghum mosaic virus (Chen et al. 2016; Gu et al. 2023). None of the viruses was detected (Supplementary Figure S2). Subsequently, a cDNA library was constructed using the Small RNA Sample Pre Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA), and sequencing was performed on the Illiumia Novaseq platform (Biomarker Technologies Corporation, Beijing, China). After eliminating low-quality reads, non-coding RNAs and duplicate reads, the remaining reads were assembled into long contigs using Velvet 1.0.5 software with a k-mer value of 17, resulting in 14 contigs ranging from 55 nt to 931 nt in length, showing nucleotide identity ranging from 94.52% to 100% with the genome of wheat dwarf India virus (WDIV, GenBank accession no. NC_017828.1). WDIV belongs to the genus Mastrevirus, family Geminiviridae, and possesses a monopartite circular single-stranded DNA genome of 2.5 to 2.7 kb (Kumar et al. 2014a). To validate the findings, total DNA was extracted from three symptomatic leaves, and the coat protein (CP) gene of WDIV was amplified using the PCR protocol with primers CP01 (5'-ATGTCTCAGGTGAAGAAGAGGAC-3') and CP02 (5'-CTACTGGTTGCCGATACTCTTGA-3') (Kumar et al. 2014b). With 99% coverage, a 744 bp fragment obtained displayed 96.10% similarity to the coat protein gene of wheat dwarf India virus clone (GenBank accession no. MN240337.1) (Supplementary Figure S3). To obtain the complete genome sequence of the virus, PCR with our own designed primers WDIV-2F (5'-ACAAGCATCCGACGAAGCAGA-3') and WDIV-2R (5'-AAATATTCTAATACAGGCACAGGCT-3') yielded a circular DNA of 2,871 bp. The amplicon was cloned into the pEASY-T1 cloning vector (Transgen, Beijing, China), and three independent positive colonies of Escherichia coli DH5α carrying the viral amplicon were sequenced. The nucleotide sequences obtained had 96.73%, 96.80%, and 96.84% nt identity with the complete gene of wheat dwarf India virus clone (GenBank accession no. MN240328.1) and were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers OR282786 - OR282788. To identify the occurrence and distribution of WDIV infection, 12 maize samples were collected from 2 different regions of Hainan province (Sanya and Wuzhishan) and tested using PCR with primers CP01 and CP02, the results showed that 2 samples collected in Sanya were positive (Supplementary Figure S4). Previous reports confirmed that WDIV infects barley, wheat, and sugarcane (Boulton et al. 2002). This study represents the first report of WDIV infecting maize in China, providing valuable insights into its host range and offering potential guidance for managing viral diseases in maize.",

      "abstract": "Rice Bakanae Disease (RBD), caused by Fusarium fujikuroi, threatens global rice production. While the phenylpyrrole fungicide fludioxonil shows efficacy against F. fujikuroi, resistance mechanisms remain understudied. The current study found that the fludioxonil sensitivity of 101 F. fujikuroi isolates collected in the rice fields of Xinxiang city in the Henan Province of China from 0.025 to 0.759 μg/mL, with an average EC50 value of 0.3441 ± 0.1961 μg/mL (SE). Four highly fludioxonil-resistant F. fujikuroi laboratory mutants were generated by repeated exposure to fludioxonil exhibited enhanced mycelial growth and sporulation, but reduced spore germination, pathogenicity, and osmotic stress tolerance, alongside abnormal hyphae. Molecular analysis identified amino acid substitutions in the target protein Ffos-1, notably at residue 672 (A672P/T). These acid amino changes reduced in the minimum binding energy (MBE) in docking models. Ffos-1 expression was significantly (P ＜ 0.05) upregulated in fludioxonil-resistant F. fujikuroi mutants. Meanwhile, cross-resistance analysis revealed a significant (p = 0.0064) correlation between fludioxonil and iprodione, but not with epoxiconazole, prothioconazole, or carbendazim. However, field-monitoring is critical, as baseline shifts could compromise fludioxonil efficacy. Findings highlight Ffos-1's role in fludioxonil action and resistance, informing integrated strategies to delay resistance spread and improve RBD management.",

      "title": "Opportunities and Challenges in Combining Optical Sensing and Epidemiological Modelling.",
      "abstract": "Plant diseases impair yield and quality of crops and threaten the health of natural plant communities. Epidemiological models can predict disease and inform management. However, data are scarce, since traditional methods to measure plant diseases are resource intensive and this often limits model performance. Optical sensing offers a methodology to acquire detailed data on plant diseases across various spatial and temporal scales. Key technologies include multispectral, hyperspectral and thermal imaging, and light detection and ranging; the associated sensors can be installed on ground-based platforms, uncrewed aerial vehicles, aeroplanes and satellites. However, despite enormous potential for synergy, optical sensing and epidemiological modelling have rarely been integrated. To address this gap, we first review the state-of-the-art to develop a common language accessible to both research communities. We then explore the opportunities and challenges in combining optical sensing with epidemiological modelling. We discuss how optical sensing can inform epidemiological modelling by improving model selection and parameterisation and providing accurate maps of host plants. Epidemiological modelling can inform optical sensing by boosting measurement accuracy, improving data interpretation and optimising sensor deployment. We consider outstanding challenges in: A) identifying particular diseases; B) data availability, quality and resolution, C) linking optical sensing and epidemiological modelling, and D) emerging diseases. We conclude with recommendations to motivate and shape research and practice in both fields. Among other suggestions, we propose to standardise methods and protocols for optical sensing of plant health and develop open access databases including both optical sensing data and epidemiological models to foster cross-disciplinary work.",

      "abstract": "Regular consumption of brown rice has been linked to a reduction in the probability of oxidative stress-related diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. The higher abundance of bioactive metabolites, including polyphenols and vitamins, in brown rice relative to white rice may contribute to its associated health benefits. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a kind of mycotoxin widely found in grains, is recognized as a primary risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Therefore, the differential polyphenol metabolites between brown rice and white rice, as natural plant antioxidants, may also be able to mitigate the oxidative damage caused by AFB1. In this work, the differential polyphenol metabolites between brown rice and white rice were identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The results showed that 35 differential metabolites were found and classified into phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans and coumarins. Among them, ferulic acid (FA) was characterized as a kind of differential metabolite that could mitigate AFB1-induced oxidative damage based on the interaction network and cell experiments. Furthermore, results of the mice experiment confirmed that FA mitigated AFB1-induced hepatic injury through a potential mechanism associated with the enhancement of antioxidant capacity, restoration of mitochondrial function and attenuation of AFB1-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, FA, identified between brown rice and white rice, could effectively alleviate AFB1-induced hepatic injury ",

      "abstract": "Naturally hydrophobic wax layer microstructures in plants seriously hinder the leaf adhesion and deposition of pesticide droplets, thereby causing low pesticide bioavailability and inevitable environmental pollution. Inspired by the supramolecular self-assembly strategy, two anisotropic supramolecular building units (BiTA18@β-CD and BiTA18@γ-CD) are invented based on the host-guest complexation between a benzimidazole-modified bactericidal molecule (BiTA18) and β-/γ-cyclodextrin (β-CD/γ-CD), which self-assemble into nano-sized hexagonal cuboids on the rice microcrystalline matrix. This consequence markedly enhances the retention of bactericidal ingredients on target plants. More intriguingly, these oligosaccharide-coated supramolecular materials, with superior biocompatibility, can break through the bacterial biofilm barrier, limit bacterial motility and extracellular enzyme secretion, and induce electrolyte leakage and ROS accumulation in bacteria, ultimately annihilating the stubborn pathogenic bacterium. Combining these excellent advantages, the optimal supramolecular material (BiTA18@β-CD) displays broad-spectrum and efficient control efficacies of 54.4% and 71.7% against rice bacterial blight and citrus bacterial canker, respectively, surpassing those of kasugamycin (34.3%/34.1%), thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (39.9%/42.7%), and BiTA18 (42.7%/46.9%) at 200 µg mL",

Even though Egypt is the highest rice producer in\nAfrica with a share of 6 million tons per year, it still imports rice to\nsatisfy its local needs due to production loss, especially due to rice disease.\nRice blast disease is responsible for 30% loss in rice production worldwide.\nTherefore, it is crucial to target limiting yield damage by detecting rice\ncrops diseases in its early stages. This paper introduces a public\nmultispectral and RGB images dataset and a deep learning pipeline for rice\nplant disease detection using multi-modal data. The collected multispectral\nimages consist of Red, Green and Near-Infrared channels and we show that using\nmultispectral along with RGB channels as input archives a higher F1 accuracy\ncompared to using RGB input only.",

In\nthis paper, we focused on the solution using computer vision technique to\ndetect rice diseases from rice field photograph images. Dealing with images\ntook in real-usage situation by general farmers is quite challenging due to\nvarious environmental factors, and rice leaf object size variation is one major\nfactor caused performance gradation. To solve this problem, we presented a\ntechnique combining a CNN object detection with image tiling technique, based\non automatically estimated width size of rice leaves in the images as a size\nreference for dividing the original input image. A model to estimate leaf width\nwas created by small size CNN such as 18 layer ResNet architecture model. A new\ndivided tiled sub-image set with uniformly sized object was generated and used\nas input for training a rice disease prediction model. Our technique was\nevaluated on 4,960 images of eight different types of rice leaf diseases,\nincluding blast, blight, brown spot, narrow brown spot, orange, red stripe,\nrice grassy stunt virus, and streak disease. The mean absolute percentage error\n(MAPE) for leaf width prediction task evaluated on all eight classes was 11.18%\nin the experiment, indicating that the leaf width prediction model performed\nwell. The mean average precision (mAP) of the prediction performance on YOLOv4\narchitecture was enhanced from 87.56% to 91.14% when trained and tested with\nthe tiled dataset.

      "abstract": "Rice Bakanae Disease (RBD), caused by Fusarium fujikuroi, threatens global rice production. While the phenylpyrrole fungicide fludioxonil shows efficacy against F. fujikuroi, resistance mechanisms remain understudied. The current study found that the fludioxonil sensitivity of 101 F. fujikuroi isolates collected in the rice fields of Xinxiang city in the Henan Province of China from 0.025 to 0.759 μg/mL, with an average EC50 value of 0.3441 ± 0.1961 μg/mL (SE). Four highly fludioxonil-resistant F. fujikuroi laboratory mutants were generated by repeated exposure to fludioxonil exhibited enhanced mycelial growth and sporulation, but reduced spore germination, pathogenicity, and osmotic stress tolerance, alongside abnormal hyphae. Molecular analysis identified amino acid substitutions in the target protein Ffos-1, notably at residue 672 (A672P/T). These acid amino changes reduced in the minimum binding energy (MBE) in docking models. Ffos-1 expression was significantly (P ＜ 0.05) upregulated in fludioxonil-resistant F. fujikuroi mutants. Meanwhile, cross-resistance analysis revealed a significant (p = 0.0064) correlation between fludioxonil and iprodione, but not with epoxiconazole, prothioconazole, or carbendazim. However, field-monitoring is critical, as baseline shifts could compromise fludioxonil efficacy. Findings highlight Ffos-1's role in fludioxonil action and resistance, informing integrated strategies to delay resistance spread and improve RBD management.",

      "abstract": "Naturally hydrophobic wax layer microstructures in plants seriously hinder the leaf adhesion and deposition of pesticide droplets, thereby causing low pesticide bioavailability and inevitable environmental pollution. Inspired by the supramolecular self-assembly strategy, two anisotropic supramolecular building units (BiTA18@β-CD and BiTA18@γ-CD) are invented based on the host-guest complexation between a benzimidazole-modified bactericidal molecule (BiTA18) and β-/γ-cyclodextrin (β-CD/γ-CD), which self-assemble into nano-sized hexagonal cuboids on the rice microcrystalline matrix. This consequence markedly enhances the retention of bactericidal ingredients on target plants. More intriguingly, these oligosaccharide-coated supramolecular materials, with superior biocompatibility, can break through the bacterial biofilm barrier, limit bacterial motility and extracellular enzyme secretion, and induce electrolyte leakage and ROS accumulation in bacteria, ultimately annihilating the stubborn pathogenic bacterium. Combining these excellent advantages, the optimal supramolecular material (BiTA18@β-CD) displays broad-spectrum and efficient control efficacies of 54.4% and 71.7% against rice bacterial blight and citrus bacterial canker, respectively, surpassing those of kasugamycin (34.3%/34.1%), thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (39.9%/42.7%), and BiTA18 (42.7%/46.9%) at 200 µg mL",

      "abstract": "Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) mimic eukaryotic transcriptional activators and translocate into host plant cells via the bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS) during pathogenic interactions. They play a crucial role in disease development by regulating host genes. Despite this, the regulatory mechanisms by which TALEs control OsWRKY transcription factors (TFs) remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that two TALEs from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) individually modulate two OsWRKY TFs, resulting in increased susceptibility and reduced host defense. Specifically, Xoo1219 and Xoo2145 activate the expression of OsWRKY104 and OsWRKY55, respectively, through direct interactions. OsWRKY104 increases the susceptibility to Xoo by activating OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14, while OsWRKY55 suppresses host defense against Xoo by directly regulating OsWRKY62. These findings suggest that TALEs hijack the host's OsWRKY TFs to create a favorable environment for bacterial survival.",

The\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the adaptive immune system at a repertoire\nlevel is complex, due to both the nuanced interaction of a TCR-pMHC pair and to\nthe number of different possible TCR-pMHC pairings, making computationally\nexact solutions currently unfeasible. To gain some insight into this problem,\nwe study an affinity-based model for TCR-pMHC binding in which a crystal\nstructure is used to generate a distance-based contact map that weights the\npairwise amino acid interactions. We find that the TCR-pMHC binding energy\ndistribution strongly depends both on the number of contacts and the repeat\nstructure allowed by the topology of the contact map of choice; this in turn\ninfluences T cell recognition probability during negative selection, with\nhigher variances leading to higher survival probabilities.

      "abstract": "Smart rice disease detection is a key part of intelligent agriculture. To address issues like low efficiency, poor accuracy, and high costs in traditional methods, this paper introduces an enhanced lightweight version of the YOLOv11-RD algorithm, enhancing multi-scale feature extraction through the integration of the enhanced LSKAC attention mechanism and the SPPF module. It also lowers computational complexity and enhances local feature capture through the C3k2-CFCGLU block. The C3k2-CSCBAM block in the neck region reduces the training overhead and boosts target learning in complex backgrounds. Additionally, a lightweight 320 × 320 LSDECD detection head improves small-object detection. Experiments on a rice disease dataset extracted from agricultural operation videos demonstrate that, compared to YOLOv11n, the algorithm improves mAP50 and mAP50-95 by 2.7% and 11.5%, respectively, while reducing the model parameters by 4.58 M and the computational load by 1.1 G. The algorithm offers significant advantages in lightweight design and real-time performance, outperforming other classical object detection algorithms and providing an optimal solution for real-time field diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Bentazone, an herbicide widely applied in rice and cereal crops, is\nwidespread in the aquatic environment. This study evaluated the capacity of\nTrametes versicolor to remove bentazone from water. The fungus was able to\ncompletely remove bentazone after three days at Erlenmeyer-scale incubation.\nBoth laccase and cytochrome P450 enzymatic systems were involved in bentazone\ndegradation. A total of 19 transformation products (TPs) were identified to be\nformed during the process. The reactions involved in their formation included\nhydroxylations, oxidations, methylations, N-nitrosation, and dimerization. A\nlaccase mediated radical mechanism was proposed for TP formation. In light of\nthe results obtained at the Erlenmeyer scale, a trickle-bed reactor with T.\nversicolor immobilized on pine wood chips was set up to evaluate its stability\nduring bentazone removal under non-sterile conditions. After 30 days of\nsequencing batch operation, an average bentazone removal of 48 % was obtained,\nwith a considerable contribution of adsorption onto the lignocellulosic support\nmaterial. Bacterial contamination, which is the bottleneck in the\nimplementation of fungal bioreactors, was successfully addressed by this\nparticular system according to its maintained performance. This research is a\npioneering step forward to the implementation of fungal bioremediation on a\nreal scale.",

      "abstract": "As the impending consequences of climate change loom over the Earth, it has\nbecome vital for researchers to understand the role microorganisms play in this\nprocess. In this paper, we examine how environmental factors, including\nmoisture levels and temperature, affect the expression of certain fungal\ncharacteristics on a microscale, and how these in turn affect fungal\nbiodiversity and ecosystem decomposition rates over time.\n  We first present a differential equation model to understand how the\ndistribution of different fungal isolates depends on regional moisture levels.\nWe introduce both slow and sudden variations into the environment in order to\nrepresent the various ways climate change will impact fungal ecosystems. This\nmodel demonstrates that increased variability in moisture (both short-term and\nlong-term) increases biodiversity and that fungal populations will shift\ntowards more stress-tolerant fungi as aridity increases. The model further\nsuggests the lack of any direct link between biodiversity and decomposition\nrates.\n  To better describe fungal competition with respect to space, we develop a\nlocal agent-based model (ABM). Unlike the previous model, our ABM focuses on\nindividuals, tracking each fungus and the result of its interactions. Our ABM\nalso features a more accurate spatial combat system, allowing us to precisely\ndiscern the influence of fungal interactions on the environment. This model\ncorroborates the results of the differential equation model and further\nsuggests that moisture, through its link with temperature and effects on fungal\npopulation, also plays a strong role in determining fungal decomposition rates.\n  Together, these models suggest that climate change, which portends increasing\nvariability in regional conditions and higher average temperatures worldwide,\nwill lead to an increase in both wood decomposition rates and, independently,\nfungal biodiversity.",

We investigated how this coupling is achieved in a bacterial phytochrome variant, Agp2-PAiRFP2. Contrary to classical protein crystallography, which only allows probing (cryo-trapped) stable states, we have used time-resolved serial femtosecond x-ray crystallography (tr-SFX) and pump-probe techniques with various illumination and delay times with respect to photoexcitation of the parent Pfr state. Thus, structural data for seven time frames were sorted into groups of molecular events along the reaction coordinate. They range from chromophore isomerization to the formation of Meta-F, the intermediate that precedes the functional relevant secondary structure transition of the tongue. Structural data for the early events were used to calculate the photoisomerization pathway to complement the experimental data. Late events allow identifying the molecular switch that is linked to the intramolecular proton transfer as a prerequisite for the following structural transitions.",

      "abstract": "Naturally hydrophobic wax layer microstructures in plants seriously hinder the leaf adhesion and deposition of pesticide droplets, thereby causing low pesticide bioavailability and inevitable environmental pollution. Inspired by the supramolecular self-assembly strategy, two anisotropic supramolecular building units (BiTA18@β-CD and BiTA18@γ-CD) are invented based on the host-guest complexation between a benzimidazole-modified bactericidal molecule (BiTA18) and β-/γ-cyclodextrin (β-CD/γ-CD), which self-assemble into nano-sized hexagonal cuboids on the rice microcrystalline matrix. This consequence markedly enhances the retention of bactericidal ingredients on target plants. More intriguingly, these oligosaccharide-coated supramolecular materials, with superior biocompatibility, can break through the bacterial biofilm barrier, limit bacterial motility and extracellular enzyme secretion, and induce electrolyte leakage and ROS accumulation in bacteria, ultimately annihilating the stubborn pathogenic bacterium. Combining these excellent advantages, the optimal supramolecular material (BiTA18@β-CD) displays broad-spectrum and efficient control efficacies of 54.4% and 71.7% against rice bacterial blight and citrus bacterial canker, respectively, surpassing those of kasugamycin (34.3%/34.1%), thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (39.9%/42.7%), and BiTA18 (42.7%/46.9%) at 200 µg mL",

      "abstract": "Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) mimic eukaryotic transcriptional activators and translocate into host plant cells via the bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS) during pathogenic interactions. They play a crucial role in disease development by regulating host genes. Despite this, the regulatory mechanisms by which TALEs control OsWRKY transcription factors (TFs) remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that two TALEs from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) individually modulate two OsWRKY TFs, resulting in increased susceptibility and reduced host defense. Specifically, Xoo1219 and Xoo2145 activate the expression of OsWRKY104 and OsWRKY55, respectively, through direct interactions. OsWRKY104 increases the susceptibility to Xoo by activating OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14, while OsWRKY55 suppresses host defense against Xoo by directly regulating OsWRKY62. These findings suggest that TALEs hijack the host's OsWRKY TFs to create a favorable environment for bacterial survival.",

      "abstract": "The addition of functional microorganisms is a common approach for remediating farmland contaminated with heavy metals, but the mechanisms underlying their reduction of crop absorption of these metals require further investigation. Here, the effect of adding Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PC) on the accumulation of heavy metals, including antimony (Sb), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn), in rice was investigated, and the possible mechanisms behind these effects were explored. The results revealed that PC treatment significantly decreased the concentrations of Sb, As, Cr, Pb and Zn in rice grains, while increasing the abundance of four beneficial bacterial genera, including Mycobacterium, Desulfovirga, Methylosarcina, and Ferruginibacter. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis showed that adding PC significantly altered the concentrations of root metabolites, including organic acids, choline, and amino acids. The affected metabolic pathways were mainly concentrated in four pathways: (1) histidine metabolism, (2) pyrimidine metabolism, (3) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, and (4) glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. These findings suggest that PC reduces the uptake of heavy metals in rice by altering root metabolism and the composition of the rhizosphere microbiome, providing valuable insights for the remediation of farmland contaminated with heavy metals.",

      "abstract": "Symbiotic interactions between microbes and their multicellular hosts have\nmanifold impacts on molecular, cellular and organismal biology. To identify\ncandidate bacterial genes involved in maintaining endosymbiotic associations\nwith insect hosts, we analyzed genome-wide patterns of gene expression in the\nalpha-proteobacteria Wolbachia pipientis across the life cycle of Drosophila\nmelanogaster using public data from the modENCODE project that was generated in\na Wolbachia-infected version of the ISO1 reference strain. We find that the\nmajority of Wolbachia genes are expressed at detectable levels in D.\nmelanogaster across the entire life cycle, but that only 7.8% of 1195 Wolbachia\ngenes exhibit robust stage- or sex-specific expression differences when studied\nin the \"holo-organism\" context. Wolbachia genes that are differentially\nexpressed during development are typically up-regulated after D. melanogaster\nembryogenesis, and include many bacterial membrane, secretion system and\nankyrin-repeat containing proteins. Sex-biased genes are often organised as\nsmall operons of uncharacterised genes and are mainly up-regulated in adult\nmales D. melanogaster in an age-dependent manner suggesting a potential role in\ncytoplasmic incompatibility. Our results indicate that large changes in\nWolbachia gene expression across the Drosophila life-cycle are relatively rare\nwhen assayed across all host tissues, but that candidate genes to understand\nhost-microbe interaction in facultative endosymbionts can be successfully\nidentified using holo-organism expression profiling. Our work also shows that\nmining public gene expression data in D. melanogaster provides a rich set of\nresources to probe the functional basis of the Wolbachia-Drosophila symbiosis\nand annotate the transcriptional outputs of the Wolbachia genome.",

Yet, viral tools to access and manipulate specific neuronal subtypes are still limited. Here, we performed systematic analysis of single-cell genomic data to identify enhancer candidates for each of the telencephalic interneuron subtypes. We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic interneurons. These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP), and manipulate (opto-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species. Thus, we provide the field with a powerful set of tools to study neural circuits and functions and to develop precise and targeted therapy.",

      "abstract": "Potyvirus is the largest genus of plant RNA viruses, and the members in the genus are known to cause significant damage to a wide variety of crops. In this study, we performed small RNA (sRNA) deep sequencing for identification of potential virus (es) in collected cucumber leaves with mosaic symptoms from fields in Beijing. Through this high-throughput sequencing and subsequent PCR amplification, we obtained a complete viral genome sequence of 10,044 bp, which showed the highest similarity to the watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) isolate FBR04-37 and exhibited the typical characteristics of potyviruses in its genome organization. The obtained WMV isolate was designated as WMV-BJ. We then constructed the infectious clone of WMV-BJ, which can successfully infect six kinds of cucurbitaceous plants by agroinfiltration. Among these, Cucumis melo showed obvious symptoms such as shrinkage and mosaic compared to other cucurbitaceous plants infected by this virus infectious clone. To understand the biological function of WMV-BJ, we further analyzed the dynamic subcellular localization and protein accumulation of WMV-BJ encoded 11 viral proteins. The results showed the WMV-BJ-encoded proteins displayed diverse subcellular localizations, and most viral proteins were easily degraded after expression in plant cells. Together, the construction of the WMV-BJ infectious clone in this study provides a valuable tool for further exploring the biology of this virus and the interaction between WMV-BJ and host plant, and useful information for investigating the functions of WMV-encoded proteins.",

      "abstract": "A hallmark of insects is their cuticle that protects them against predators and parasites, prevents desiccation and xenobiotic penetration and, finally, serves locomotion as an exoskeleton. In the last two decades, tremendous efforts have yielded a plethora of molecular and histological data that have boosted our understanding of the mechanisms of cuticle formation and function. As the factors involved in cuticle formation and function are to a large extent specific to insects, these data may be used in intelligent pest management strategies. The brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens is a major rice pest in Asia. Cuticle research in this species has been following findings in other insect species recapitulating most collected results. There are, in addition, several important data in N. lugens that advanced our understanding in cuticle biology in insects generally. For instance, it was demonstrated in the brown planthopper that a chitin-binding protein, namely NlugCpr47 is needed for organ shaping. Moreover, based on genetic data, it was hypothesised that cuticular lipids may be organised in layers depending on the size of the molecules. Finally, pore canals, the nanotubes system that is used as a transport route for cuticle lipid deposition, were visualised in 3D with high resolution for the first time in an insect. These examples, reviewed in this article, underline the importance of a detailed molecular and histological approach in non-model insects for a better understanding of cuticle biology in general.",

Applying a non-Bayesian time-varying model approach to the\nfundamental equation for spot returns and the futures premium, we detect when\nefficiency reductions in the two major rice markets occurred. We also examine\nhow government interventions affected the rice markets in Japan, which\ncolonized Taiwan and Korea before World War II, and argue that the function of\nrice futures markets crucially depended on the differences in rice spot\nmarket's structure. The increased volume of imported rice of a different\nvariety from domestic rice first disrupted the rice futures. Then, government\nintervention in the rice futures markets failed to improve the disruption.\nChanges in colonial rice cropping successfully improved the disruption, and\ncolonial rice was promoted to unify the different varieties of inland and\ncolonial rice.",

VmSR1 associates with the Tudor staphylococcal nuclease 2 (TSN2) proteins in Malus domestica (apple), Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana, promotes degradation of TSN2 proteins, and suppresses the abundance of multiple miRNAs an Silencing of TSN2 significantly reduced the abundance of miRNAs and weakened the resistance of apple leaves to V. mali as well as N. benthamiana to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.

We considered disease outbreaks in a setting\nwith dense genomic sampling, and formulated stochastic epidemic models to\ninvestigate person-to-person transmission, based on observed genomic and\nepidemiological data. We constructed models in which the genetic distance\nbetween sampled genotypes depends on the epidemiological relationship between\nthe hosts. A data augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to\nsample over the transmission trees, providing a posterior probability for any\ngiven transmission route. We investigated the predictive performance of our\nmethodology using simulated data, demonstrating high sensitivity and\nspecificity, particularly for rapidly mutating pathogens with low\ntransmissibility. We then analyzed data collected during an outbreak of\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a hospital, identifying probable\ntransmission routes and estimating epidemiological parameters. Our approach\novercomes limitations of previous methods, providing a framework with the\nflexibility to allow for unobserved infection times, multiple independent\nintroductions of the pathogen, and within-host genetic diversity, as well as\nallowing forward simulation.",

      "abstract": "The stacked contact process is a three-state spin system that describes the\nco-evolution of a population of hosts together with their symbionts. In a\nnutshell, the hosts evolve according to a contact process while the symbionts\nevolve according to a contact process on the dynamic subset of the lattice\noccupied by the host population, indicating that the symbiont can only live\nwithin a host. This paper is concerned with a generalization of this system in\nwhich the symbionts may affect the fitness of the hosts by either decreasing\n(pathogen) or increasing (mutualist) their birth rate. Standard coupling\narguments are first used to compare the process with other interacting particle\nsystems and deduce the long-term behavior of the host-symbiont system in\nseveral parameter regions. The mean-field approximation of the process is also\nstudied in detail and compared to the spatial model. Our main result focuses on\nthe case where unassociated hosts have a supercritical birth rate whereas hosts\nassociated to a pathogen have a subcritical birth rate. In this case, the\nmean-field model predicts coexistence of the hosts and their pathogens provided\nthe infection rate is large enough. For the spatial model, however, only the\nhosts survive on the one-dimensional integer lattice.",

      "title": "The apple of discord: can spider cocoons be equipped with antimicrobial factors?-a systematic review.",
      "abstract": "The antimicrobial properties of spider silk have been a topic of scientific intrigue since ancient times. Despite extensive research, the question remains unresolved due to conflicting findings and methodological challenges. This work revisits and synthesizes current knowledge, proposing that spider cocoons, rather than other spider products, serve as a particularly promising focus for investigating antimicrobial factors. This emphasis arises from their critical role in parental investment and reproductive success, as the maternal care associated with spider egg sacs suggests the necessity for enhanced antimicrobial protection to safeguard offspring. By investigating existing research, we propose that the protective properties of spider egg sacs may derive not only from the silk itself, but also from the eggs contained within, as supported by previous hypotheses. Furthermore, drawing on the body of knowledge, we suggest that potential antimicrobial defense mechanisms may extend beyond intrinsic factors, encompassing interactions with microorganisms, plants, and other possible environmental elements that remain unexplored but may likely be interconnected. This review highlights that the potential interplay of these factors may be complex and possibly influenced by ecological and biological contexts. Unraveling these dynamics requires an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating diverse methodologies and perspectives to address the gaps in current knowledge. By refining the focus and embracing a broader conceptual framework, future research can provide definitive insights into the antimicrobial properties of spider cocoons. Resolving this long-standing question will not only clarify the scientific debate but also deepen our understanding of spider biology and the adaptive strategies that have evolved to ensure reproductive success.",

      "abstract": "Apple viruses pose significant threat to global apple production. In this study, HTS technology was used to investigate the apple virome in the Czech Republic. Previously reported viruses, including ACLSV, ASPV, ASGV, ApMV, AGCaV, and CCGaV, were confirmed, and near-complete genomes were assembled. Additionally, two novel viruses, ARWV1 and ARWV2 were identified for the first time in the Czech Republic. Phylogenetic analyses showed low genetic variability among ARWV2 isolates, suggesting a possible recent introduction or limited diversification. In contrast, ARWV1 isolates displayed distinct clustering in the coat protein coding region, separating symptomatic and asymptomatic samples, indicating a potential involvement of genetic determinants in symptom expression. Mixed infections were prevalent, with multiple molecular variants of ACLSV, ASPV, and AGCaV detected within individual samples, along with co-infections involving viruses from different families. Recombination analysis identified frequent recombination events in ACLSV and ASPV, often involving non-apple parental sequences, suggesting their potential for cross-host infections. Additionally, an interspecific recombination event was detected in an almond ApMV isolate, with PNRSV as a minor parent. These findings highlight the impact of agricultural practices on viral evolution and host adaptation. This study demonstrates the utility of HTS as a powerful tool for uncovering viral diversity, recombination events, and evolutionary dynamics.",

Five combinations of false-colour images\nwere created from the spectral data and the segmentation net results. The\nimages were trained and evaluated with a modified version of the YOLOv5\nnetwork. Despite the promising results of deep learning using RGB images\n(P=0.8, mAP@50=0.73), the detection of apple scab in apple trees using\nmultispectral imaging proved to be a difficult task.

      "abstract": "As the impending consequences of climate change loom over the Earth, it has\nbecome vital for researchers to understand the role microorganisms play in this\nprocess. In this paper, we examine how environmental factors, including\nmoisture levels and temperature, affect the expression of certain fungal\ncharacteristics on a microscale, and how these in turn affect fungal\nbiodiversity and ecosystem decomposition rates over time.\n  We first present a differential equation model to understand how the\ndistribution of different fungal isolates depends on regional moisture levels.\nWe introduce both slow and sudden variations into the environment in order to\nrepresent the various ways climate change will impact fungal ecosystems. This\nmodel demonstrates that increased variability in moisture (both short-term and\nlong-term) increases biodiversity and that fungal populations will shift\ntowards more stress-tolerant fungi as aridity increases. The model further\nsuggests the lack of any direct link between biodiversity and decomposition\nrates.\n  To better describe fungal competition with respect to space, we develop a\nlocal agent-based model (ABM). Unlike the previous model, our ABM focuses on\nindividuals, tracking each fungus and the result of its interactions. Our ABM\nalso features a more accurate spatial combat system, allowing us to precisely\ndiscern the influence of fungal interactions on the environment. This model\ncorroborates the results of the differential equation model and further\nsuggests that moisture, through its link with temperature and effects on fungal\npopulation, also plays a strong role in determining fungal decomposition rates.\n  Together, these models suggest that climate change, which portends increasing\nvariability in regional conditions and higher average temperatures worldwide,\nwill lead to an increase in both wood decomposition rates and, independently,\nfungal biodiversity.",

The micropillars can show significant deformations upon\nevaporation, just as capillary action does in soft substrates. The phenomenon\nhas been studied with five bacterial strains S. epidermidis, L. sakei, P.\naeruginosa, E. coli and B. subtilis. The results reveal that only droplets\ncontaining motile microbes with flagella stimulate micropillar bending, which\nleads to significant distortions and pillar aggregations forming dimers,\ntrimers, and higher order clusters. Such deformation is manifested in\ncharacteristic patterns that are left on the microarrayed surface following\nevaporation, and can be easily identified even by the naked eye.

The\npresence of weakly coordinating CN groups increases the release of silver ions\ninto the bacterial and yeast cell environments.

      "abstract": "Apple viruses pose significant threat to global apple production. In this study, HTS technology was used to investigate the apple virome in the Czech Republic. Previously reported viruses, including ACLSV, ASPV, ASGV, ApMV, AGCaV, and CCGaV, were confirmed, and near-complete genomes were assembled. Additionally, two novel viruses, ARWV1 and ARWV2 were identified for the first time in the Czech Republic. Phylogenetic analyses showed low genetic variability among ARWV2 isolates, suggesting a possible recent introduction or limited diversification. In contrast, ARWV1 isolates displayed distinct clustering in the coat protein coding region, separating symptomatic and asymptomatic samples, indicating a potential involvement of genetic determinants in symptom expression. Mixed infections were prevalent, with multiple molecular variants of ACLSV, ASPV, and AGCaV detected within individual samples, along with co-infections involving viruses from different families. Recombination analysis identified frequent recombination events in ACLSV and ASPV, often involving non-apple parental sequences, suggesting their potential for cross-host infections. Additionally, an interspecific recombination event was detected in an almond ApMV isolate, with PNRSV as a minor parent. These findings highlight the impact of agricultural practices on viral evolution and host adaptation. This study demonstrates the utility of HTS as a powerful tool for uncovering viral diversity, recombination events, and evolutionary dynamics.",

Bacteriophages of the Chimalliviridae family sequester their genomes within a phage-generated organelle, the phage nucleus, which is enclosed by a lattice of the viral protein ChmA. We show that inhibiting phage nucleus formation arrests infections at an early stage in which the injected phage genome is enclosed within a membrane-bound early phage infection (EPI) vesicle. Early phage genes are expressed from the EPI vesicle, demonstrating its functionality as a prokaryotic, transcriptionally active, membrane-bound organelle. We also show that the phage nucleus is essential, with genome replication beginning after the injected DNA is transferred from the EPI vesicle to the phage nucleus. Our results show that Chimalliviridae require two sophisticated subcellular compartments of distinct compositions and functions that facilitate successive stages of the viral life cycle.",

      "abstract": "GC-content, the ratio of guanine and cytosine bases in an entire nucleotide\nsequence, and palindromic sequences are unique for every organism due to\ngenomic evolution. The goals of our research was to establish a correlation\nbetween GC-content and palindromic densities in wild-type viral and\nrandomly-generated genomes. Forty viral genomes were downloaded from GenBank\nand their GC-ratios and palindromic densities were calculated and plotted using\nMathematica. The palindromic densities-by-GC-ratios plot of randomly generated\nsequences (palindromic density curve) exhibited a quadratic relationship and\nwas superimposed over the viral genome plot. It was observed that the viral\nplots followed the curvature of the random sequences' quadratic curve,\nsignifying a directly proportional relationship between GC-content and\npalindrome density in viral genomes. However, because viral genomes require\ncertain non-palindromic sequences to function, the palindromic densities of\nmost wild-type genomes were under the palindromic density curve. The variance\nin palindrome densities of wild-type genomes in respect to the random\nsequences' quadratic curve may be examined to determine evolutionary traits in\ngenomes. A better understanding of viral palindromic densities and GC-ratios\nwould help in understanding conserved secondary RNA structures in viral genomes\nand future drug discovery. In addition, certain viral genomes were found to be\nviable recombinant viruses, which are used in gene therapy.",

      "abstract": "This review discusses the antioxidant potential of oleanolic acid, a triterpene compound present in many medicinal and edible plants. The authors analyze various studies that confirm numerous pharmacological properties of this compound, such as its anticancer, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, osteoprotective, anti-obesity, and anti-inflammatory effects. OA, as a natural antioxidant, plays an important role in neutralizing reactive oxygen species, which contribute to the oxidative stress that is responsible for the development of many diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. This article also presents natural sources of OA, including grapes, olives, and apples, and discusses the mechanisms of its antioxidant action, including the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and the modulation of signaling pathways related to inflammatory processes. In addition, there are research results that indicate the therapeutic benefits of OA in the treatment of diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as its potential to protect the heart, liver, and kidneys from oxidative damage. In conclusion, OA has potent antioxidant properties that can be used in the prevention and treatment of many diseases related to oxidative stress. This article also presents the possibility of increasing the bioavailability of OA through the use of nanoparticle and liposome technology.",

      "abstract": "Curcumin as a natural polyphenolic compound has excellent antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. However, its hydrophobicity and sensitivity to environmental conditions, such as light, heat, and pH, limit its practical application in food preservation. In this study, sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) complexed with curcumin (Cur) was used to prepare inclusion complexes (SBE-β-CD@Cur), which were then integrated into a gelatin matrix assembled by hydrogen-bonding cross-linking to form composite films (SBE-β-CD@Cur/Gel) with a sustained-release effect for fruit preservation. The encapsulation of curcumin by SBE-β-CD reached 89.65%; the inclusion complex and gelatin molecules were assembled into a dense and high-toughness composite film through hydrogen-bonding cross-linking, with a maximum tensile strength of 15.99 MPa and excellent surface hydrophobicity and oxygen barrier properties. The composite film's slow-release action enabled curcumin to demonstrate more lasting antioxidant effects, with 1,1-diphenyl-2-trinitrohydrazine and 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid radical scavenging rates maintaining about 80% even after 10 days of storage. The SBE-β-CD@Cur/Gel film can effectively inhibit the harm of foodborne pathogens. Finally, the advantages of composite films in food preservation and environmentally friendly characteristics were determined through grape preservation and soil biodegradation tests. The multifunctional composite films prepared via a simple hydrogen-bonded assembly strategy advance understanding of cyclodextrin-encapsulated hydrophobic actives and curcumin's slow-release potential in food preservation.",

      "title": "A transcriptomic perspective of P trade in mycorrhizal grapevine.",
      "abstract": "Nutrient exchanges are a key feature of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera), one of the most economically important crops worldwide, relies heavily on AM symbiosis for its growth and development. Since the phylloxera crisis, cultivated grapevines are obtained by grafting a Vitis vinifera scion onto a rootstock. In this study, we investigated the responses of the rootstock \"Riparia Gloire de Montpellier\" to mycorrhizal root colonization under three distinct phosphate (P) levels. We explored regulatory aspects of plant P nutrition by comparing the transcriptome profiling of non-colonized roots and roots colonized by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198. We have shown that P availability significantly influences gene expression in both the AM fungus and the grapevine. Our transcriptomic study shed light on the molecular mechanisms that prevail during the AM symbiosis of a perennial woody plant species, with available P affecting several functional classes of proteins. The nine genes coding for Pht1 transporters in the R. irregularis genome were either down-regulated (RiPT1 and RiPT2) or up-regulated by the high-P treatment (RiPT8 and RiPT11), up-regulated by the low-P treatment (RiPT5), and regulated in a P-dose-dependent manner (RiPT9 and RiPT10). Expression of two of the three identified AM-induced Pht1, VvPT4 and VvPT8, was enhanced under mycorrhizal conditions, but finely tuned by the P treatment. To immunolocalize VvPT4 and VvPT8, we developed an innovative root-clearing protocol specifically designed for woody plants. This technological advancement has made it possible to visualize only VvPT4 at the periarbuscular membrane of mature arbuscules, its expression being strongly influenced by differences in P availability.",

The role of abiotic factors is crucial in shaping the distribution patterns of microorganisms, its abundance and also the interactions between species, from local to the global level. In the particular case of the vineyard, the microbial communities have a potential impact in both the grapevine development and health and, later on, in the grape production and quality. The present review focuses on how the composition of soil microbial communities is influenced by climate and several edaphic factors, such as soil moisture, soil nutrients and soil pH.

      "abstract": "As the impending consequences of climate change loom over the Earth, it has\nbecome vital for researchers to understand the role microorganisms play in this\nprocess. In this paper, we examine how environmental factors, including\nmoisture levels and temperature, affect the expression of certain fungal\ncharacteristics on a microscale, and how these in turn affect fungal\nbiodiversity and ecosystem decomposition rates over time.\n  We first present a differential equation model to understand how the\ndistribution of different fungal isolates depends on regional moisture levels.\nWe introduce both slow and sudden variations into the environment in order to\nrepresent the various ways climate change will impact fungal ecosystems. This\nmodel demonstrates that increased variability in moisture (both short-term and\nlong-term) increases biodiversity and that fungal populations will shift\ntowards more stress-tolerant fungi as aridity increases. The model further\nsuggests the lack of any direct link between biodiversity and decomposition\nrates.\n  To better describe fungal competition with respect to space, we develop a\nlocal agent-based model (ABM). Unlike the previous model, our ABM focuses on\nindividuals, tracking each fungus and the result of its interactions. Our ABM\nalso features a more accurate spatial combat system, allowing us to precisely\ndiscern the influence of fungal interactions on the environment. This model\ncorroborates the results of the differential equation model and further\nsuggests that moisture, through its link with temperature and effects on fungal\npopulation, also plays a strong role in determining fungal decomposition rates.\n  Together, these models suggest that climate change, which portends increasing\nvariability in regional conditions and higher average temperatures worldwide,\nwill lead to an increase in both wood decomposition rates and, independently,\nfungal biodiversity.",

      "abstract": "Grapes are a globally significant fruit crop, but their cultivation is often challenged by leaf diseases, which limit industrial productivity. Rain-shelter cultivation has emerged as a sustainable agricultural strategy to mitigate these challenges. This study examines the effects of rain-shelter cultivation, compared to open-air cultivation, on the microclimate within the grape canopy and the microbial ecology of the grape phyllosphere. The research focused on two cultivation methods: rain-shelter and open-air cultivation. Key environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity within the grape canopy were measured during the growing season. The study also explored how these conditions influence the biodiversity, stability, and functional roles of phyllosphere microbiota, particularly focusing on the community assembly processes of bacteria and oomycetes, and the efficacy of culturable microorganisms in combating grape leaf diseases. The results showed that rain-shelter cultivation signifcantly reduced leaf humidity, increased canopy temperature, and decreased light intensity, regardless of weather conditions. This approach led to a significant decrease in the incidence of grape downy mildew without affecting the overall Shannon diversity index of phyllosphere microbes. At the Class level, there was a reduction in Cystobasidiomycetes, Bacteroidia, Brocadiae, and Phycisphaerae, while Oligoflexia levels are significantly increased under rain-shelter conditions. Genus-level analysis revealed significant reductions in plant pathogens such as Erysiphe, Alternaria, and Cercospora. The study found that rain-shelter cultivation shifts fungal community assembly from stochastic to deterministic processes, while bacterial networks showed increased stability. Additionally, the beneficial microorganism Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited a preventive effect against grape leaf diseases, enhancing grape berry quality by increasing puncture resistance and leaf internode length. These findings provide understanding of the complex relationship between grape canopy microclimate, disease management, and microbial dynamics suggesting rain-shelter cultivation as a viable strategy for sustainable grape production, it offers insights into the research and development of future biological control agents.",

      "abstract": "Grape drying promote agentia (GDPA) plays a crucial role in raisin production and is widely used. These accelerators primarily consist of alkaline reagents, lipid compounds and other drying agents. They function by undergoing saponification reactions to produce higher fatty acid salts, which disrupt the waxy layer of grape skins, thereby accelerating the dehydration process of grapes. To assess the potential cellular and organ toxicity linked to GDPA consumption, this study conducted the TK gene mutation test and the bacterial reverse mutation assay, confirm that it does not have mutagenic toxicity. Furthermore, we utilized MTT staining to quantify the cellular damage caused by GDPA in human normal liver cells, determining that the half maximal inhibitory concentration exceeds 4 mg/mL. In addition, acute and subacute toxicity tests were conducted on rats, with dosage levels set at a lower limit of 500 mg/kg for acute testing and 250 mg/kg for subacute testing, respectively. In Sprague Dawley rats, a single dose of 5000 mg/kg GDPA or continuous dose of 1500 mg/kg GDPA can cause reversible specific toxic effects on the liver, kidneys, and jejunum. The dietary risk assessment showed that the acute, subacute, and cumulative risk quotients of GDPA in raisins were below 100 %, indicating that this pre-treatment method would not cause unacceptable acute health risks. Our research provides a scientific basis for advocating the judicious use of desiccants, expanding their application to a broader range of agricultural commodities, and helping to establish standardized processing protocols for crops like grapes.",

The GRAPE-3A can efficiently calculate gravitational\nforce between particles, and construct neighbor lists. All other calculations\nare performed on the host workstation (WS) which is directly connected to\nGRAPE. The use of GRAPE for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (GRAPE-SPH) can in\nprinciple greatly speed up the calculations on WS. However the current\nbottleneck of GRAPE-SPH is that its performance is limited by the speed of the\nhost WS. To solve this problem, we implement Remote-GRAPE; it allows us to run\napplications which use GRAPE-3A hardware on the significantly faster computers\nthan the physical host WS. Thus, we can take advantage of the fast computers\neven though they can not physically be connected to GRAPE. The Remote-GRAPE\nsystem is implemented on the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM).

      "abstract": "Cyproconazole (CPZ) was identified as a new postharvest fungicide with incomplete cross resistance to other DMI fungicides registered for managing major decays of citrus. CPZ was effective on lemons, oranges, grapefruit, and mandarins, significantly reducing sour rot (Geotrichum citri-aurantii) and green mold (Penicillium digitatum). In laboratory and experimental packingline studies, CPZ was compatible with other fungicides, performed well in fruit coatings, and was effective using different application systems. CPZ at 300 to 1,250 µg/ml reduced sour rot incidence of lemons inoculated with a propiconazole (PPZ) moderately resistant (MR) isolate of G. citri-aurantii from 87.5% in the control to between 54.6% and 13.3%, whereas. green mold caused by an imazalil (IMZ)-resistant (R) isolate of P. digitatum was reduced from 99.0% in the control to between 59.9% and 20.8%. CPZ at 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 µg/ml in aqueous or storage coating preparations generally performed statistically similar against PPZ-sensitive (S), -MR, and -highly resistant (HR) isolates of G. citri-aurantii. Sour rot was reduced to zero levels with increasing concentrations for S-, and MR-isolates, whereas decay caused by the HR-isolate was reduced from 97.1% in the control to 26.0% in storage wax treatments. For green mold and sporulation control, storage and pack coatings generally reduced the performance of CPZ, PPZ, IMZ, fludioxonil+azoxystrobin, and mixtures as compared to aqueous applications. CPZ was not as effective as IMZ or fludioxonil+azoxystrobin in reducing sporulation. There was no significant difference in efficacy between heated and ambient-temperature flooder applications of CPZ or PPZ in controlling sour rot or green mold. CPZ is currently undergoing registration for postharvest use on citrus in the United States and will be an effective treatment by itself and in mixtures with other fungicides for major decays caused by S and R pathogens.",

      "abstract": "Naturally hydrophobic wax layer microstructures in plants seriously hinder the leaf adhesion and deposition of pesticide droplets, thereby causing low pesticide bioavailability and inevitable environmental pollution. Inspired by the supramolecular self-assembly strategy, two anisotropic supramolecular building units (BiTA18@β-CD and BiTA18@γ-CD) are invented based on the host-guest complexation between a benzimidazole-modified bactericidal molecule (BiTA18) and β-/γ-cyclodextrin (β-CD/γ-CD), which self-assemble into nano-sized hexagonal cuboids on the rice microcrystalline matrix. This consequence markedly enhances the retention of bactericidal ingredients on target plants. More intriguingly, these oligosaccharide-coated supramolecular materials, with superior biocompatibility, can break through the bacterial biofilm barrier, limit bacterial motility and extracellular enzyme secretion, and induce electrolyte leakage and ROS accumulation in bacteria, ultimately annihilating the stubborn pathogenic bacterium. Combining these excellent advantages, the optimal supramolecular material (BiTA18@β-CD) displays broad-spectrum and efficient control efficacies of 54.4% and 71.7% against rice bacterial blight and citrus bacterial canker, respectively, surpassing those of kasugamycin (34.3%/34.1%), thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (39.9%/42.7%), and BiTA18 (42.7%/46.9%) at 200 µg mL",

      "abstract": "Citrus diseases pose threats to citrus farming and result in economic losses\nworldwide. Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and,\nimmunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are\nlaborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and\ncontamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising\nalternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and\ndemonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for\ndisease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical\nspectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial\nphases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and\ncommercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental\nworking principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and\nlimitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic\nimaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in\ncitrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of\noptical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field\nmeasurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf\nspectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including\nfuture insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover,\nthe role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools\nfor spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus\nleaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging\ncompositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant\nleaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development\nand commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid\nand early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.",

      "abstract": "The detection of leaf diseases in plants generally involves visual\nobservation of patterns appearing on the leaf surface. However, there are many\ndiseases that are distinguished based on very subtle changes in these visually\nobservable patterns. This paper attempts to identify plant leaf diseases using\nimage processing techniques. The focus of this study is on the detection of\ncitrus leaf canker disease. Canker is a bacterial infection of leaves. Symptoms\nof citrus cankers include brown spots on the leaves, often with a watery or\noily appearance. The spots (called lesions in botany) are usually yellow. It is\nsurrounded by a halo of the leaves and is found on both the top and bottom of\nthe leaf. This paper describes various methods that have been used to detect\ncitrus leaf canker disease. The methods used are histogram comparison and\nk-means clustering. Using these methods, citrus canker development was detected\nbased on histograms generated based on leaf patterns. The results thus obtained\ncan be used, after consultation with experts in the field of agriculture, to\nidentify suitable treatments for the processes used.",

      "abstract": "Cyproconazole (CPZ) was identified as a new postharvest fungicide with incomplete cross resistance to other DMI fungicides registered for managing major decays of citrus. CPZ was effective on lemons, oranges, grapefruit, and mandarins, significantly reducing sour rot (Geotrichum citri-aurantii) and green mold (Penicillium digitatum). In laboratory and experimental packingline studies, CPZ was compatible with other fungicides, performed well in fruit coatings, and was effective using different application systems. CPZ at 300 to 1,250 µg/ml reduced sour rot incidence of lemons inoculated with a propiconazole (PPZ) moderately resistant (MR) isolate of G. citri-aurantii from 87.5% in the control to between 54.6% and 13.3%, whereas. green mold caused by an imazalil (IMZ)-resistant (R) isolate of P. digitatum was reduced from 99.0% in the control to between 59.9% and 20.8%. CPZ at 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 µg/ml in aqueous or storage coating preparations generally performed statistically similar against PPZ-sensitive (S), -MR, and -highly resistant (HR) isolates of G. citri-aurantii. Sour rot was reduced to zero levels with increasing concentrations for S-, and MR-isolates, whereas decay caused by the HR-isolate was reduced from 97.1% in the control to 26.0% in storage wax treatments. For green mold and sporulation control, storage and pack coatings generally reduced the performance of CPZ, PPZ, IMZ, fludioxonil+azoxystrobin, and mixtures as compared to aqueous applications. CPZ was not as effective as IMZ or fludioxonil+azoxystrobin in reducing sporulation. There was no significant difference in efficacy between heated and ambient-temperature flooder applications of CPZ or PPZ in controlling sour rot or green mold.

      "abstract": "Naturally hydrophobic wax layer microstructures in plants seriously hinder the leaf adhesion and deposition of pesticide droplets, thereby causing low pesticide bioavailability and inevitable environmental pollution. Inspired by the supramolecular self-assembly strategy, two anisotropic supramolecular building units (BiTA18@β-CD and BiTA18@γ-CD) are invented based on the host-guest complexation between a benzimidazole-modified bactericidal molecule (BiTA18) and β-/γ-cyclodextrin (β-CD/γ-CD), which self-assemble into nano-sized hexagonal cuboids on the rice microcrystalline matrix. This consequence markedly enhances the retention of bactericidal ingredients on target plants. More intriguingly, these oligosaccharide-coated supramolecular materials, with superior biocompatibility, can break through the bacterial biofilm barrier, limit bacterial motility and extracellular enzyme secretion, and induce electrolyte leakage and ROS accumulation in bacteria, ultimately annihilating the stubborn pathogenic bacterium. Combining these excellent advantages, the optimal supramolecular material (BiTA18@β-CD) displays broad-spectrum and efficient control efficacies of 54.4% and 71.7% against rice bacterial blight and citrus bacterial canker, respectively, surpassing those of kasugamycin (34.3%/34.1%), thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (39.9%/42.7%), and BiTA18 (42.7%/46.9%) at 200 µg mL",

      "abstract": "Flavanones, a key subclass of flavonoids, exhibit a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Predominantly found in citrus fruits, they occur in both aglycone and glycosylated forms, undergoing extensive metabolic transformation upon ingestion. Recent evidence suggests that flavanones, such as naringenin and hesperidin, influence gut microbiota composition, fostering a balance between beneficial and pathogenic bacterial populations. The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in regulating the gut-brain axis, impacting cognitive function through the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), neurotransmitters, and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The modulation of the gut microbiome by flavanones has been associated with improvements in cognitive performance and a reduced risk of neurodegenerative disorders. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of major flavanones, their metabolic pathways, and their impact on gut microbiota and cognitive function. It covers the fundamental mechanisms through which flavanones exert their effects, as well as their potential therapeutic applications for brain health and neuroprotection. Despite promising findings, further research is needed to determine optimal dosages, strategies to enhance bioavailability, and long-term safety profiles.",

The pathogen CLas is an unculturable, phloem-limited α-proteobacterium associated with HLB. Phages, known for their ability to directly lyse pathogenic bacteria, have been widely recognized as effective control agents in both medical and agricultural fields. In this study, we identified 191 prophages across 48 Liberibacter genomes using comparative genomics and phylogenetic methods. These prophages were classified into 17 distinct types, with 13 novel types, named NF1 to NF13. Diversity analysis revealed that the number of prophages per genome ranged from one to eight, with an average of four. Annotation showed that the genome sizes of NF1-NF13 ranged from 10,160 bp to 72,736 bp, with an average size of 27,616 bp, containing between 7 and 66 genes (average: 27 genes). Further functional enrichment of the sequences within 5 kb upstream and downstream of the integration site identified six main aspects, involving four core biological processes: genome structure modification, gene expression regulation, stress response activation, and metabolic pathway modulation.

While most\ncurrent image segmentation approaches achieve good segmentation results by\npixel-wise segmentation, these supervised learning-based methods require a\nlarge amount of annotated data, and do not consider the continuous temporal\nchanges of citrus position in real-world applications. In this paper, we first\ntrain a simple CNN with a small number of labelled citrus images in a\nsupervised manner, which can roughly predict the citrus location from each\nframe. Then, we extend a state-of-the-art unsupervised learning approach to\npre-learn the citrus's potential movements between frames from unlabelled\ncitrus's videos. To take advantages of both networks, we employ the multimodal\ntransformer to combine supervised learned static information and unsupervised\nlearned movement information. The experimental results show that combing both\nnetwork allows the prediction accuracy reached at 88.3$\\%$ IOU and 93.6$\\%$\nprecision, outperforming the original supervised baseline 1.2$\\%$ and 2.4$\\%$.\nCompared with most of the existing citrus segmentation methods, our method uses\na small amount of supervised data and a large number of unsupervised data,\nwhile learning the pixel level location information and the temporal\ninformation of citrus changes to enhance the segmentation effect.",

      "abstract": "Citrus diseases pose threats to citrus farming and result in economic losses\nworldwide. Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and,\nimmunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are\nlaborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and\ncontamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising\nalternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and\ndemonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for\ndisease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical\nspectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial\nphases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and\ncommercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental\nworking principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and\nlimitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic\nimaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in\ncitrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of\noptical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field\nmeasurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf\nspectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including\nfuture insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover,\nthe role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools\nfor spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus\nleaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging\ncompositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant\nleaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development\nand commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid\nand early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.",

      "abstract": "Citrus diseases pose threats to citrus farming and result in economic losses\nworldwide. Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and,\nimmunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are\nlaborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and\ncontamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising\nalternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and\ndemonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for\ndisease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical\nspectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial\nphases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and\ncommercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental\nworking principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and\nlimitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic\nimaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in\ncitrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of\noptical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field\nmeasurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf\nspectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including\nfuture insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover,\nthe role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools\nfor spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus\nleaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging\ncompositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant\nleaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development\nand commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid\nand early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.",

      "abstract": "Naturally hydrophobic wax layer microstructures in plants seriously hinder the leaf adhesion and deposition of pesticide droplets, thereby causing low pesticide bioavailability and inevitable environmental pollution. Inspired by the supramolecular self-assembly strategy, two anisotropic supramolecular building units (BiTA18@β-CD and BiTA18@γ-CD) are invented based on the host-guest complexation between a benzimidazole-modified bactericidal molecule (BiTA18) and β-/γ-cyclodextrin (β-CD/γ-CD), which self-assemble into nano-sized hexagonal cuboids on the rice microcrystalline matrix. This consequence markedly enhances the retention of bactericidal ingredients on target plants. More intriguingly, these oligosaccharide-coated supramolecular materials, with superior biocompatibility, can break through the bacterial biofilm barrier, limit bacterial motility and extracellular enzyme secretion, and induce electrolyte leakage and ROS accumulation in bacteria, ultimately annihilating the stubborn pathogenic bacterium. Combining these excellent advantages, the optimal supramolecular material (BiTA18@β-CD) displays broad-spectrum and efficient control efficacies of 54.4% and 71.7% against rice bacterial blight and citrus bacterial canker, respectively, surpassing those of kasugamycin (34.3%/34.1%), thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (39.9%/42.7%), and BiTA18 (42.7%/46.9%) at 200 µg mL",

Canker is a bacterial infection of leaves. Symptoms\nof citrus cankers include brown spots on the leaves, often with a watery or\noily appearance. The spots (called lesions in botany) are usually yellow. It is\nsurrounded by a halo of the leaves and is found on both the top and bottom of\nthe leaf. This paper describes various methods that have been used to detect\ncitrus leaf canker disease. The methods used are histogram comparison and\nk-means clustering. Using these methods, citrus canker development was detected\nbased on histograms generated based on leaf patterns. The results thus obtained\ncan be used, after consultation with experts in the field of agriculture, to\nidentify suitable treatments for the processes used.",

      "abstract": "Citrus leprosis is a major viral disease transmitted by the citrus leprosis mite (Brevipalpus spp.), causing significant economic losses in Brazilian citrus farming. This study developed a sequential sampling plan for Brevipalpus spp. in two citrus cultivation systems. Two plots in an orange orchard ('Pêra Rio' variety) in Capitão Poço, Pará, Brazil, were selected: one under monoculture and the other intercropped with teak. Monthly sampling from September 2015 to August 2016 involved 112 georeferenced plants per plot. Mite counts were performed on six fruits, branches, and leaves from both inner and outer plant parts using a 10 × pocket lens. Aggregation indices, including variance-to-mean ratio, Morisita's index, Green's coefficient, and Taylor's power law, revealed an aggregated distribution for all variables. The k parameter of the negative binomial distribution confirmed aggregation, and this model provided the best fit for both systems. The sequential sampling plan determined that the maximum expected sampling units for decision-making is 21 mites per plant and 28 mites per six branches in both systems. These thresholds were established based on the observed distribution pattern and aim to enhance monitoring efficiency. Although these values may seem low, they indicate the infestation level at which control measures should be implemented to prevent economic losses. These findings contribute to improved monitoring strategies for Brevipalpus spp. in citrus orchards, supporting more effective pest management.",

      "abstract": "Citrus segmentation is a key step of automatic citrus picking. While most\ncurrent image segmentation approaches achieve good segmentation results by\npixel-wise segmentation, these supervised learning-based methods require a\nlarge amount of annotated data, and do not consider the continuous temporal\nchanges of citrus position in real-world applications. In this paper, we first\ntrain a simple CNN with a small number of labelled citrus images in a\nsupervised manner, which can roughly predict the citrus location from each\nframe. Then, we extend a state-of-the-art unsupervised learning approach to\npre-learn the citrus's potential movements between frames from unlabelled\ncitrus's videos. To take advantages of both networks, we employ the multimodal\ntransformer to combine supervised learned static information and unsupervised\nlearned movement information. The experimental results show that combing both\nnetwork allows the prediction accuracy reached at 88.3$\\%$ IOU and 93.6$\\%$\nprecision, outperforming the original supervised baseline 1.2$\\%$ and 2.4$\\%$.\nCompared with most of the existing citrus segmentation methods, our method uses\na small amount of supervised data and a large number of unsupervised data,\nwhile learning the pixel level location information and the temporal\ninformation of citrus changes to enhance the segmentation effect.",

      "title": "Optical Screening of Citrus Leaf Diseases Using Label-Free Spectroscopic\n  Tools: A Review",
      "abstract": "Citrus diseases pose threats to citrus farming and result in economic losses\nworldwide. Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and,\nimmunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are\nlaborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and\ncontamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising\nalternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and\ndemonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for\ndisease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical\nspectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial\nphases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and\ncommercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental\nworking principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and\nlimitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic\nimaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in\ncitrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of\noptical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field\nmeasurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf\nspectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including\nfuture insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover,\nthe role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools\nfor spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus\nleaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging\ncompositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant\nleaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development\nand commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid\nand early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.",

This study aims to enhance the catalytic efficiency and longevity of palladium nanoflower (PdNFs) catalysts by developing catalysts with a high specific surface area and abundant active sites. Using an electrochemical hydrogenation system, the effects of this catalyst on trans fatty acid (TFA) content and hydrogenation selectivity in the hydrogenated oil were investigated. A controlled-morphology palladium nanoflowers supported on carbon (PdNFs/C) catalyst was synthesized via a chemical reduction process and subsequently used to electrochemically hydrogenate soybean oil. Results indicated that heating duration substantially impacts the morphology of palladium catalysts. Specifically, insufficient or excessive heating times reduce the specific surface area and crystallization degree of palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs), thereby affecting catalytic performance. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of PdNFs/C, prepared with a heating time of 35 min, reached 230.75 cm",

      "abstract": "Soybeans are an important crop for global food security. Every year, soybean\nyields are reduced by numerous soybean diseases, particularly the soybean cyst\nnematode (SCN). It is difficult to visually identify the presence of SCN in the\nfield, let alone its population densities or numbers, as there are no obvious\naboveground disease symptoms. The only definitive way to assess SCN population\ndensities is to directly extract the SCN cysts from soil and then extract the\neggs from cysts and count them. Extraction is typically conducted in commercial\nsoil analysis laboratories and university plant diagnostic clinics and involves\nrepeated steps of sieving, washing, collecting, grinding, and cleaning. Here we\npresent a robotic instrument to reproduce and automate the functions of the\nconventional methods to extract nematode cysts from soil and subsequently\nextract eggs from the recovered nematode cysts. We incorporated mechanisms to\nactuate the stage system, manipulate positions of individual sieves using the\ngripper, recover cysts and cyst-sized objects from soil suspended in water, and\ngrind the cysts to release their eggs. All system functions are controlled and\noperated by a touchscreen interface software. The performance of the robotic\ninstrument is evaluated using soil samples infested with SCN from two farms at\ndifferent locations and results were comparable to the conventional technique.\nOur new technology brings the benefits of automation to SCN soil diagnostics, a\nstep towards long-term integrated pest management of this serious soybean pest.",

      "abstract": "Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but\nfaces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability\nin conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in\nspatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational\ndependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an\ninterpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that\nsynergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for\nrelational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent\nleaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices\nand adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion\nfeatures and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity\nchallenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM\nvisualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions.\nEvaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves\n$97.16\\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\\le95.04\\%$) and traditional\nmachine learning models ($\\le77.05\\%$). Ablation studies validate the\nsequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model\nconfigurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight\nMobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling\nreal-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed\napproach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical\napplicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural\ndiagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance in food poses a significant threat to public health, and the persistence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in ready-to-eat fermented foods (RTE-FFs) is a growing concern. However, information on the diversity, origins, and transferability of ARGs in RTE-FFs is limited. This study investigated the distribution of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in four types of RTE-FFs: soybean, dairy, meat, and vegetable products. Using whole metagenomic sequencing, we identified significant variations in the bacterial diversity, ARG profiles, and MGE profiles among these food types. Bean-based RTE-FFs exhibited the highest diversity of ARGs and MGEs, while dairy products showed the lowest diversity (p < 0.05). Eight types of ARGs were significantly more prevalent in bean-based foods than in the other food categories (p < 0.05). Several ARGs were highly abundant in the RTE-FFs, including aphA2, blaTEM-116, PBP1a, PBP1b, OqxA, OqxBgb, lsa(A), tet(34), and tet(58). Plasmids carried the highest number of ARGs among all MGEs, particularly those associated with beta-lactam, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance, suggesting a higher risk with plasmid-mediated transfer, especially in bean-based RTE-FFs. Metagenomic binning analysis recovered 76 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including four novel species. A total of 13 types of ARGs, encompassing 95 subtypes, were identified across the MAGs; Bacillus paranthracis, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus gallinarum had the most ARGs (16, 12, and 14, respectively). Dairy RTE-FFs (yogurt and cheese) contained a high abundance of Streptococcus thermophilus resistant to beta-lactams (PBP1b) and tetracycline (tetB(60)), raising concerns about ARG transfer in these food products. Bean RTE-FFs (sufu) harbored two pathogenic Acinetobacter species carrying carbapenem resistance genes (blaOXA-180, blaOXA-211, and blaOXA-230). No ARGs were found in the MGEs (prophages, insertion sequences, or transposons) within the MAGs. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the antibiotic resistome and mobilome of various RTE-FFs to inform food production and management practices.",

      "abstract": "Phakopsora pachyrhizi is a biotrophic fungus that requires living plant\ntissue to survive in the wild for extended periods. The fungus causes Asian\nrust and costs billions of US dollars every year for its control in South\nAmerican soy production. Despite the regulatory measure that prohibits the\ncultivation of soybeans in some months of the year (soybean-free period) in\nBrazil, the presence of soybean production areas in neighboring countries, such\nas Paraguay and Bolivia, can help the survival of the pathogen between crop\nseasons. It is known that P. pachyrhizi urediniospores can be\nspread/transported thousands of kilometres by the wind. In this context, the\nobjective of this work was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the\natmospheric transport of P. pachyrhizi urediniospores from the west,\nParaguay/Bolivia to Paran\\'a Brazil, through storms coming from cold fronts.\nThe transport of urediniospores was modeled by a diffusive-convective-reactive\nequation. Wind direction and the velocity of cold fronts that crossed Paran\\'a\nstate between October 2018 and February 2019 were used. For validation, real\ncases of rust occurrence in the Paran\\'a state informed by the Anti-rust\nConsortium Portal in the season 2018/19 were used. The results confirm\nmathematically that urediniospores from infected areas located in a country on\nthe west can be transported and deposited on the east, in the state of\nParan\\'a. The first case of soybean rust in Paran\\'a state/Brazil was\nregistered 10 days after the first cold front, suggesting that the transported\nand deposited urediniospores were still viable for host infection. This work\nreinforces the importance of the establishment of the soybean-free period in\nother soybean-producing countries. It will also provide a better understanding\nof the fungus dispersion system, potentially enabling the correct use of\nfungicides.",

However, information on the diversity, origins, and transferability of ARGs in RTE-FFs is limited. This study investigated the distribution of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in four types of RTE-FFs: soybean, dairy, meat, and vegetable products. Using whole metagenomic sequencing, we identified significant variations in the bacterial diversity, ARG profiles, and MGE profiles among these food types. Bean-based RTE-FFs exhibited the highest diversity of ARGs and MGEs, while dairy products showed the lowest diversity (p < 0.05). Eight types of ARGs were significantly more prevalent in bean-based foods than in the other food categories (p < 0.05). Several ARGs were highly abundant in the RTE-FFs, including aphA2, blaTEM-116, PBP1a, PBP1b, OqxA, OqxBgb, lsa(A), tet(34), and tet(58). Plasmids carried the highest number of ARGs among all MGEs, particularly those associated with beta-lactam, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance, suggesting a higher risk with plasmid-mediated transfer, especially in bean-based RTE-FFs. Metagenomic binning analysis recovered 76 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including four novel species. A total of 13 types of ARGs, encompassing 95 subtypes, were identified across the MAGs; Bacillus paranthracis, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus gallinarum had the most ARGs (16, 12, and 14, respectively). Dairy RTE-FFs (yogurt and cheese) contained a high abundance of Streptococcus thermophilus resistant to beta-lactams (PBP1b) and tetracycline (tetB(60)), raising concerns about ARG transfer in these food products. Bean RTE-FFs (sufu) harbored two pathogenic Acinetobacter species carrying carbapenem resistance genes (blaOXA-180, blaOXA-211, and blaOXA-230). No ARGs were found in the MGEs (prophages, insertion sequences, or transposons) within the MAGs.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of soybean seed treatment with systemic insecticides and fungicides to protect against M. armatus adults. These adults were exposed to active ingredients and combinations of systemic insecticides and fungicides, and the effects were observed after direct planting. The study was conducted in an experimental field in the municipality of São Gabriel do Oeste, in state of MS, Brazil. The field was sown with the 8473RSF Desafios RR soybean cultivar, in randomized blocks with six treatments and four replications per treatment, such as the control (untreated); pyraclostrobin, thiophanate -methyl, fipronil; clothianidin + thiophanate -methyl, fluazinam; cyantraniliprole + thiophanate -methyl, fluazinam; fipronil + thiophanate -methyl, fluazinam; and thiamethoxam + fipronil + thiophanate -methyl, fluazinam, used at dosages of 100 kg of soybean seeds for the protect soybean plants against attacks by M. armatus and fungi. Five adult insects were released per cage for artificial infestation. The lowest number of attacked plants occurred in the treatments with pyraclostrobin; fipronil and thiamethoxam + fipronil, 21 days after infestation (DAI). The treatment with thiamethoxam + fipronil differed statistically from the control, with efficiency of 85%. The lowest percentage of dead plants was found in the treatment with thiamethoxam + fipronil at 0.96%. The treatment with thiamethoxam + fipronil in combination was most efficient for controlling M. armatus.",

Straw return (STR) and manure fertilization (MF) are critical measures to improve soil quality and crop yield. However, the effect of STR and MF on the soil properties of the parent material remains unclear. We conducted a 1-year pot experiment in the field using the soil parent material of degraded black soil to evaluate the effects of STR and MF on soil nutrients, microbial community, and soybean yield. We analyzed these effects using two treatments (STR and MF) in three soybean growth stages (seedling, flowering, and maturity) and a control group (CK). The MF treatment had higher α and β diversity of soil microbial than the CK during all soybean growth stages. Similarly, STR had higher soil microbial α diversity at the maturity stage and lower diversity at the seedling stage. Co-occurrence network analysis suggested that STR and MF increased the proportion of positively correlated edges in soil bacterial and fungal networks compared to the CK. Notably, the treatments enriched beneficial taxa, such as ",

      "abstract": "Soil erosion has caused the loss of black soil and exposed the soil parent material in the cultivated layer of sloping farmland in Northeast China. Straw return (STR) and manure fertilization (MF) are critical measures to improve soil quality and crop yield. However, the effect of STR and MF on the soil properties of the parent material remains unclear. We conducted a 1-year pot experiment in the field using the soil parent material of degraded black soil to evaluate the effects of STR and MF on soil nutrients, microbial community, and soybean yield. We analyzed these effects using two treatments (STR and MF) in three soybean growth stages (seedling, flowering, and maturity) and a control group (CK). The MF treatment had higher α and β diversity of soil microbial than the CK during all soybean growth stages. Similarly, STR had higher soil microbial α diversity at the maturity stage and lower diversity at the seedling stage. Co-occurrence network analysis suggested that STR and MF increased the proportion of positively correlated edges in soil bacterial and fungal networks compared to the CK. Notably, the treatments enriched beneficial taxa, such as ",

Deep learning-based methods can achieve accurate training and\nstrong generalization capabilities, but it demands massive labeled data, which\nis often a limitation, especially for agricultural applications. As lacking the\nlabeled data to train an in-situ segmentation model for on-branch soybean pods,\nwe propose a transfer learning from synthetic in-vitro soybean pods. First, we\npresent a novel automated image generation method to rapidly generate a\nsynthetic in-vitro soybean pods dataset with plenty of annotated samples. The\nin-vitro soybean pods samples are overlapped to simulate the frequently\nphysically touching of on-branch soybean pods. Then, we design a two-step\ntransfer learning.

In the second step, transferring from\nsimulation to reality is performed by finetuning on a few real-world mature\nsoybean plant samples.

In this tritrophic system, the insect is the only natural vector of the virus and soybean is a host-plant for both pests/pathogen. The almost unavoidable co-evolution of pathogen-vector with that of the R-genes in soybean plants through an endless arms race to avoid each other's defense-attack mechanisms raises interesting questions. The objectives of this work were to (i) develop double-resistant recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with a Rag2-Rsv1-h gene haplotype in coupling phase using resistance alleles from two different genetic sources (PI 243540 (Rag2) and Suweon 97 (Rsv1-h)), (ii) confirm phenotypically the resistant reaction against both pests in double-resistant RILs, and (iii) dissect the Rag2-Rsv1-h region with molecular markers and investigate the potential for structural variation.",

Despite its biological significance, the genetic characteristics and stress-responsive mechanisms of TCTP remain uncharacterized in soybean. This study identifies GmTCTP2 as a drought-responsive gene showing transcriptional upregulation under PEG-induced dehydration and multiple abiotic stresses. Through comprehensive interaction assays including GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), we demonstrate that GmTCTP2 physically interacts with the SUMO E2 conjugate enzyme GmSCEc. This interaction enables GmTCTP2 SUMOylation at lysine residues 101 and 167, significantly enhancing its protein stability under drought conditions.

      "abstract": "The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, is an important plant disease vector and a highly polyphagous agricultural pest that feeds on a broad range of host plants. During feeding, its salivary glands serve as a route for the transmission of circulative plant viruses and produce a range of secretory proteins, called effectors, to modulate host cellular processes. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying aphid-plant interactions, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline that incorporated the salivary gland transcriptome, genome, and head vs abdomen differential gene expression data to predict secretory protein-encoding genes enriched in the salivary glands of A. gossypii. Annotation of the 351 predicted genes showed that the most abundant functional categories were associated with cellular signaling and metabolism processes, and revealed that 98 genes were hemipteran-specific. Notably, 51 genes encode secretory proteins matching the putative saliva proteins identified in prior proteomics studies. Quantitative PCR analysis validated differential expression of 4 selected genes between heads and abdomens and indicated that alate adults exhibited the highest gene expression, suggesting these genes may play key roles in host colonization. Additionally, 25 genes showed sequence similarities to functionally characterized hemipteran effectors, with some appearing to form effector groups with distinct evolutionary patterns. Collectively, this study identified numerous putative plant-manipulating genes in A. gossypii and provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of aphid-plant interactions.",

      "abstract": "Cotton is a vital economic crop in global agriculture and the textile industry, contributing significantly to food security, industrial competitiveness, and sustainable development. Traditional technologies such as spectral imaging and machine learning improved cotton cultivation and processing, yet their performance often falls short in complex agricultural environments. Deep learning (DL), with its superior capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and autonomous decision-making, offers transformative potential across the cotton value chain. This review highlights DL applications in seed quality assessment, pest and disease detection, intelligent irrigation, autonomous harvesting, and fiber classification et al. DL enhances accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, promoting the modernization of cotton production and precision agriculture. However, challenges remain, including limited model generalization, high computational demands, environmental adaptability issues, and costly data annotation. Future research should prioritize lightweight, robust models, standardized multi-source datasets, and real-time performance optimization. Integrating multi-modal data-such as remote sensing, weather, and soil information-can further boost decision-making. Addressing these challenges will enable DL to play a central role in driving intelligent, automated, and sustainable transformation in the cotton industry.",

      "abstract": "Cotton is a major cash crop, and increasing its production is extremely important worldwide, especially in agriculture-led economies. The crop is susceptible to various diseases, leading to decreased yields. In recent years, advancements in deep learning methods have enabled researchers to develop automated methods for detecting diseases in cotton crops. Such automation not only assists farmers in mitigating the effects of the disease but also conserves resources in terms of labor and fertilizer costs. However, accurate classification of multiple diseases simultaneously in cotton remains challenging due to multiple factors, including class imbalance, variation in disease symptoms, and the need for real-time detection, as most existing datasets are acquired under controlled conditions. This research proposes a novel method for addressing these challenges and accurately classifying seven classes, including six diseases and a healthy class. We address the class imbalance issue through synthetic data generation using conventional methods like scaling, rotating, transforming, shearing, and zooming and propose a customized StyleGAN for synthetic data generation. After preprocessing, we combine features extracted from MobileNet and VGG16 to create a comprehensive feature vector, passed to three classifiers: Long Short Term Memory Units, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. We propose a StackNet-based ensemble classifier that takes the output probabilities of these three classifiers and predicts the class label among six diseases-Bacterial blight, Curl virus, Fusarium wilt, Alternaria, Cercospora, Greymildew-and a healthy class. We trained and tested our method on publicly available datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 97%. Our robust method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques to identify the six diseases and the healthy class.",

Our model\ndemonstrates exceptional performance, accurately classifying seven cotton\ndisease types with an overall accuracy of 98.42% and class-wise precision\nranging from 96% to 100%. This results in significantly enhanced efficiency,\nsurpassing recent approaches in accuracy and model complexity.

The substantial performance\nimprovement, combined with the lightweight nature of the model, makes it\npractically suitable for real-world applications in smart farming.

Climate-smart agricultural technologies are\nbeing developed to boost yields while decreasing operating expenses. Crop yield\nprediction, on the other hand, is difficult because of the complex and\nnonlinear impacts of cultivar, soil type, management, pest and disease,\nclimate, and weather patterns on crops. To solve this issue, we employ machine\nlearning (ML) to forecast production while considering climate change, soil\ndiversity, cultivar, and inorganic nitrogen levels. From the 1980s to the\n1990s, field data were gathered across the southern cotton belt of the United\nStates. To capture the most current effects of climate change over the previous\nsix years, a second data source was produced using the process-based crop\nmodel, GOSSYM. We concentrated our efforts on three distinct areas inside each\nof the three southern states: Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia. To simplify the\namount of computations, accumulated heat units (AHU) for each set of\nexperimental data were employed as an analogy to use time-series weather data.\nThe Random Forest Regressor yielded a 97.75% accuracy rate, with a root mean\nsquare error of 55.05 kg/ha and an R2 of around 0.98.

      "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to characterize the biosecurity practices implemented on pig farms in Hong Kong and determine the between-farm prevalence of economically important viral pathogens. All active pig farms in Hong Kong (n = 40) were invited to participate in an interview-based survey using a Biocheck-UGent™ questionnaire to evaluate their biosecurity practices. Pen-level oral fluid samples were collected by cotton ropes to detect six target viral pathogens using RT-PCR: porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type-2 (PCV-2), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine delta-coronavirus (PDCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Eighteen farms (45 %) accepted our invitation and participated in this study. Biosecurity practices were found to be inadequate in many areas, with an average overall score of 50.1 ± 9.4 (mean ± SD). The study farms scored higher for external biosecurity (56.4 ± 8.6) than internal biosecurity practices (43.9 ± 12.1). Among external biosecurity subcategories, breeding pig and semen purchase scored highest (93.2), while visitors and farmworkers scored lowest (23.5). In internal biosecurity, the disease management subcategory received the highest score (66.7). Only two external biosecurity subcategories, breeding pig and semen purchase (93.2), and farm location (70) exceeded the global average scores. Key deficiencies were identified in biosecurity protocols for visitors and workers, hygiene standards for feed, water, and equipment supplies, and measures to prevent disease transmission between compartments (farrowing, nursery, and finishing units). Over 90 % of participating farms implemented vaccination programs for PRRSV, PCV-2, porcine parvovirus (PPV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) while no farms vaccinated against SIV, and vaccination for swine coronaviruses was sporadic. All target viruses except TGEV were detected at the farm level. The between-farm prevalences among the 18 study farms were PRRSV-2 (94.4 %), PRRSV-1 (38.9 %), PCV-2 (83.3 %), SIV (55.6 %), PDCoV (16.7 %), and PEDV (5.6 %). We provided comprehensive baseline information on the biosecurity practices of pig farms for the first time in Hong Kong. We identified critical areas of biosecurity for improvement and offered tailored recommendations to help the producers implement more effective prevention and control strategies for infectious diseases within and between farms.",

      "abstract": "As emerging zoonoses represent a significant public health threat, understanding how pathogens' host ranges evolve is critical to protect human and wildlife health. Closely related hosts infected with host-specific pathogens provide valuable opportunities for clear inferences of host range evolution, as they allow for the examination of early diversification patterns in their resident pathogens. Pneumocystis, an obligate lung symbiont that is believed to be ubiquitous in mammals, exemplifies such a model. To explore the early stages of divergence in Pneumocystis, we collected geographically dispersed samples from two sister species of deer mice: Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mice) and Peromyscus gossypinus (cotton mice). We sequenced two nuclear and two mitochondrial loci of Pneumocystis sampled from the lungs of these mice. These sequences revealed three distinct Pneumocystis taxa, two of which were found to cross-infect both host species and were often found coexisting within the same individual. Genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the three Pneumocystis taxa represent separate species. Further analysis of the mitochondrial large subunit rRNA gene from the most common taxon of these three revealed that host geographic origins influenced Pneumocystis genetic structure more than host species identity. Nevertheless, the results also suggest an overall interconnectedness of the symbiont metapopulation.",

      "abstract": "Cottonseed is a valuable source of high-quality proteins and oils. Defatted cottonseed meal (DCSM), a by-product of cottonseed oil extraction, holds significant potential as a sustainable protein resource. This review outlines the chemical composition, structural features, and unique properties of cottonseed, with a focus on its inherent antinutritional factors, such as gossypol. Strategies for enhancing the utilization of DCSM as a protein source are systematically evaluated, including physical, chemical, and biological methods used to eliminate or reduce antinutritional components. Among these, microbial fermentation, particularly solid-state fermentation, is highlighted as a promising, eco-friendly approach for detoxification and nutritional improvement. This review further discusses critical factors influencing the removal of anti-nutritional compounds, such as pretreatment methods, fermentation parameters, and microbial strains. The efficacy of probiotic strains (e.g., ",

      "abstract": "Cotton is a major cash crop, and increasing its production is extremely important worldwide, especially in agriculture-led economies. The crop is susceptible to various diseases, leading to decreased yields. In recent years, advancements in deep learning methods have enabled researchers to develop automated methods for detecting diseases in cotton crops. Such automation not only assists farmers in mitigating the effects of the disease but also conserves resources in terms of labor and fertilizer costs. However, accurate classification of multiple diseases simultaneously in cotton remains challenging due to multiple factors, including class imbalance, variation in disease symptoms, and the need for real-time detection, as most existing datasets are acquired under controlled conditions. This research proposes a novel method for addressing these challenges and accurately classifying seven classes, including six diseases and a healthy class. We address the class imbalance issue through synthetic data generation using conventional methods like scaling, rotating, transforming, shearing, and zooming and propose a customized StyleGAN for synthetic data generation. After preprocessing, we combine features extracted from MobileNet and VGG16 to create a comprehensive feature vector, passed to three classifiers: Long Short Term Memory Units, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. We propose a StackNet-based ensemble classifier that takes the output probabilities of these three classifiers and predicts the class label among six diseases-Bacterial blight, Curl virus, Fusarium wilt, Alternaria, Cercospora, Greymildew-and a healthy class. We trained and tested our method on publicly available datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 97%. Our robust method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques to identify the six diseases and the healthy class.",

      "abstract": "As the impending consequences of climate change loom over the Earth, it has\nbecome vital for researchers to understand the role microorganisms play in this\nprocess. In this paper, we examine how environmental factors, including\nmoisture levels and temperature, affect the expression of certain fungal\ncharacteristics on a microscale, and how these in turn affect fungal\nbiodiversity and ecosystem decomposition rates over time.\n  We first present a differential equation model to understand how the\ndistribution of different fungal isolates depends on regional moisture levels.\nWe introduce both slow and sudden variations into the environment in order to\nrepresent the various ways climate change will impact fungal ecosystems. This\nmodel demonstrates that increased variability in moisture (both short-term and\nlong-term) increases biodiversity and that fungal populations will shift\ntowards more stress-tolerant fungi as aridity increases. The model further\nsuggests the lack of any direct link between biodiversity and decomposition\nrates.\n  To better describe fungal competition with respect to space, we develop a\nlocal agent-based model (ABM). Unlike the previous model, our ABM focuses on\nindividuals, tracking each fungus and the result of its interactions. Our ABM\nalso features a more accurate spatial combat system, allowing us to precisely\ndiscern the influence of fungal interactions on the environment. This model\ncorroborates the results of the differential equation model and further\nsuggests that moisture, through its link with temperature and effects on fungal\npopulation, also plays a strong role in determining fungal decomposition rates.\n  Together, these models suggest that climate change, which portends increasing\nvariability in regional conditions and higher average temperatures worldwide,\nwill lead to an increase in both wood decomposition rates and, independently,\nfungal biodiversity.",

Further, other\nmedications have to be orally administered for managing pain and wound healing.\nTherefore, in the current work, nanomaterials having drug releasing and\nantibacterial properties is coated onto the cotton gauze bandage to minimize\nthe local pain and post-dressing infections at a wound site. We fabricated\ndiclofenac sodium (an anti-inflammatory drug) loaded biodegradable,\npolycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers mat through electrospinning and deposited it\nover the surface of a CGB that was initially coated by chitosan and decorated\nwith ZnO nanoparticles. Chitosan coating over the CGB provides the\nantibacterial properties while the drug loaded nanofibers mat releases\ndiclofenac sodium under a simulated drug release condition. In addition, the\ndecorated ZnO nanoparticles have ultra violet radiation blocking properties.\nThe modified bandage was characterised by SEM, EDAX, DSC, UV spectroscopy, and\nFTIR. The antibacterial property of the bandage was evaluated through zone of\ninhibition test during the anti-bacterial study. Thereafter, drug release and\ndegradation studies revealed the modified bandage could provide sustained drug\nrelease for 15 days, perhaps through surface erosion and later bulk degradation\nmechanism. Thus, the nanomaterials decorated CGB can be a better alternative to\nnative CGB for wound dressing applications.",

      "abstract": "Purtscher-like retinopathy (PLR) is a rare retinal vasculopathy characterized by acute vision loss. It is typically associated with systemic diseases such as renal impairment. The combined incidence of Purtscher retinopathy and PLR is estimated at 0.24 cases per million annually. The hallmark of PLR is sudden-onset visual acuity reduction accompanied by retinal findings, including Purtscher flecken, hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots.",

      "title": "Characterization of biosecurity practices and viral infections on pig farms in Hong Kong.",
      "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to characterize the biosecurity practices implemented on pig farms in Hong Kong and determine the between-farm prevalence of economically important viral pathogens. All active pig farms in Hong Kong (n = 40) were invited to participate in an interview-based survey using a Biocheck-UGent™ questionnaire to evaluate their biosecurity practices. Pen-level oral fluid samples were collected by cotton ropes to detect six target viral pathogens using RT-PCR: porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type-2 (PCV-2), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine delta-coronavirus (PDCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Eighteen farms (45 %) accepted our invitation and participated in this study. Biosecurity practices were found to be inadequate in many areas, with an average overall score of 50.1 ± 9.4 (mean ± SD). The study farms scored higher for external biosecurity (56.4 ± 8.6) than internal biosecurity practices (43.9 ± 12.1). Among external biosecurity subcategories, breeding pig and semen purchase scored highest (93.2), while visitors and farmworkers scored lowest (23.5). In internal biosecurity, the disease management subcategory received the highest score (66.7). Only two external biosecurity subcategories, breeding pig and semen purchase (93.2), and farm location (70) exceeded the global average scores. Key deficiencies were identified in biosecurity protocols for visitors and workers, hygiene standards for feed, water, and equipment supplies, and measures to prevent disease transmission between compartments (farrowing, nursery, and finishing units). Over 90 % of participating farms implemented vaccination programs for PRRSV, PCV-2, porcine parvovirus (PPV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) while no farms vaccinated against SIV, and vaccination for swine coronaviruses was sporadic. All target viruses except TGEV were detected at the farm level. The between-farm prevalences among the 18 study farms were PRRSV-2 (94.4 %), PRRSV-1 (38.9 %), PCV-2 (83.3 %), SIV (55.6 %), PDCoV (16.7 %), and PEDV (5.6 %). We provided comprehensive baseline information on the biosecurity practices of pig farms for the first time in Hong Kong. We identified critical areas of biosecurity for improvement and offered tailored recommendations to help the producers implement more effective prevention and control strategies for infectious diseases within and between farms.",

      "title": "Mucosal vaccines with STING-agonist liposomal formulations inhibit RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) replication in cotton rats.",
      "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in immunocompromised individuals. While recent breakthroughs in vaccine design have led to approved vaccines for the elderly, these vaccines are all administered through the parenteral route. Vaccine administration through the mucosal route could protect the viral route of entry and can be advantageous over injected vaccines. There is however a lack of safe and efficacious mucosal adjuvants that can facilitate both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Here, we present preclinical data based on liposomal nanoparticles, NanoSTING, that encapsulate the endogenous STING-agonist 2'3'-cGAMP (cyclic guanosine adenosine monophosphate) as adjuvant for prefusion protein-based intranasal vaccines against RSV. NanoSTING significantly increased the immunogenicity of well-documented RSV prefusion protein antigens DS-CaV1, sc9-10 DS-CaV1, and SC-TM after a single intranasal dose, when compared to the protein-only and naked-cGAMP adjuvanted groups. Two doses of NanoSTING adjuvanted vaccines yielded robust secretory IgA titers at the mucosal surfaces and induced potent Th1 T-cell responses in the lungs of vaccinated mice. Both NanoSTING-sc9-10 DS-CaV1 and NanoSTING-SCTM vaccines protect against viral replication at the upper (nose) and lower (lung) respiratory tract of RSV-challenged cotton rats. The ability of our mucosal vaccines against RSV to elicit immunity in the respiratory tract can prevent the establishment of infection in individuals and potentially prevent disease transmission.",

      "abstract": "The utility of wearing simple cloth face masks is analyzed using\ncomputational fluid dynamics simulations. We simulate the aerodynamic flow\nthrough the mask and the spatial spread of droplet ejecta resulting from\nrespiratory events such as coughing or sneezing. Without a mask, a turbulent\njet forms, and droplets with a broad size distribution are ejected. Large\ndroplets (greater than about 125 {\\mu}m in diameter) fall to the ground within\nabout 2 m, while turbulent clouds transport a mist of small aerosolized\ndroplets over significant distances (~ 5 m), consistent with reported\nexperimental findings. A loosely fitted simple cotton cloth mask (with a pore\nsize ~ 4 microns) qualitatively changes the propagation of the high velocity\njet, and largely eliminates the turbulent cloud downstream of the mask. About\n12\\% of the airflow leaks around the sides of a mask, considering a uniform gap\nof only 1 mm all around, between the face and the mask. The spread of ejecta is\nalso changed, with most large droplets trapped at the mask surface. We present\nthe viral load in the air and deposited around the person, and show that\nwearing even a simple cloth mask substantially decreases the extent of spatial\nspread of virus particles when an infected person coughs or sneezes.",
