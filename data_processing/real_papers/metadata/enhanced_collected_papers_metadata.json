      "abstract": "Despite advances in methods to interrogate tumor biology, the observational\nand population-based approach of classical cancer research and clinical\noncology does not enable anticipation of tumor outcomes to hasten the discovery\nof cancer mechanisms and personalize disease management. To address these\nlimitations, individualized cancer forecasts have been shown to predict tumor\ngrowth and therapeutic response, inform treatment optimization, and guide\nexperimental efforts. These predictions are obtained via computer simulations\nof mathematical models that are constrained with data from a patient's cancer\nand experiments. This book chapter addresses the validation of these\nmathematical models to forecast tumor growth and treatment response. We start\nwith an overview of mathematical modeling frameworks, model selection\ntechniques, and fundamental metrics. We then describe the usual strategies\nemployed to validate cancer forecasts in preclinical and clinical scenarios.\nFinally, we discuss existing barriers in validating these predictions along\nwith potential strategies to address them.",

      "abstract": "Pituitary gonadotropins play an essential and pivotal role in the control of\nhuman and animal reproduction within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)\naxis. The computational modeling of pituitary gonadotropin signaling\nencompasses phenomena of different natures such as the dynamic encoding of\ngonadotropin secretion, and the intracellular cascades triggered by\ngonadotropin binding to their cognate receptors, resulting in a variety of\nbiological outcomes. We overview historical and ongoing issues in modeling and\ndata analysis related to gonadotropin secretion in the field of both physiology\nand neuro-endocrinology. We mention the different mathematical formalisms\ninvolved, their interest and limits. We discuss open statistical questions in\nsignal analysis associated with key endocrine issues. We also review recent\nadvances in the modeling of the intracellular pathways activated by\ngonadotropins, which yields promising development for innovative approaches in\ndrug discovery. The greatest challenge to be tackled in computational modeling\nof pituitary gonadotropin signaling is the embedding of gonadotropin signaling\nwithin its natural multi-scale environment, from the single cell level, to the\norganic and whole HPG level. The development of modeling approaches of G\nprotein-coupled receptor signaling, together with multicellular systems biology\nmay lead to unexampled mechanistic understanding with critical expected\nfallouts in the therapeutic management of reproduction.",

      "title": "Genomics-guided drawing of malignant regulatory signatures revealed a\n  pivotal role of human stem cell-associated retroviral sequences (SCARS) and\n  functionally-active hESC enhancers",
      "abstract": "From patients and physicians perspectives, the clinical definition of a tumor\nmalignant phenotype could be restricted to the early diagnosis of sub-types of\nmalignancies with the increased risk of existing therapy failure and high\nlikelihood of death from cancer. It is the viewpoint from which the\nunderstanding of malignant regulatory signatures is considered in this\ncontribution. Analyses from this perspective of experimental and clinical\nobservations revealed the pivotal role of human stem cell-associated retroviral\nsequences (SCARS) in the origin and pathophysiology of clinically-lethal\nmalignancies. SCARS represent evolutionary- and biologically-related family of\ngenomic regulatory sequences, the principal physiological function of which is\nto create and maintain the stemness phenotype during human preimplantation\nembryogenesis. SCARS expression must be silenced during cellular\ndifferentiation and SCARS activity remains silent in most\nterminally-differentiated human cells performing specialized functions in the\nhuman body. De-repression and sustained activation of SCARS result in\ndifferentiation-defective phenotypes, tissue- and organ-specific clinical\nmanifestations of which are diagnosed as pathological conditions defined by a\nconsensus of pathomorphological, molecular, and genetic examinations as the\nmalignant growth. Contemporary evidence are presented that high-fidelity\nmolecular signals of continuing activities of SCARS in association with genomic\nregulatory networks of thousands functionally-active enhancers triggering\nengagements of down-stream genetic loci may serve as both reliable diagnostic\ntools and druggable molecular targets readily amenable for diagnosis and\nefficient therapeutic management of clinically-lethal malignancies.",

      "abstract": "To predict if developing human embryos are permissive to coronaviruses, we\nanalyzed publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets of zygotes, 4-cell,\n8-cell, morula, inner cell mass, epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm\nfor the coronavirus receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP), the Spike protein\ncleavage enzymes (TMPRSS2, CTSL). We also analyzed the presence of host genes\ninvolved in viral replication, the endosomal sorting complexes required for\ntransport (ESCRT) and SARS-Cov-2 interactions. The results reveal that ACE2,\nBSG, DPP4 and ANPEP are expressed in the cells of the zygote, to blastocyst\nincluding the trophectodermal lineage. ACE2, TMPRSS, BSG and CTSL are\nco-transcribed in a proportion of epiblast cells and most cells of the\ntrophectoderm. The embryonic and trophectodermal cells also express genes for\nproteins ESCRT, viral replication and those that interact with SARS-CoV-2. We\nidentified 1985 genes in epiblast and 1452 genes in the trophectoderm that are\nenriched in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells; 216 genes of these are\ncommon in both the cell types. These genes are associated with lipid\nmetabolism, lysosome, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.\nTogether our results suggest that developing human embryos could be permissive\nto coronavirus entry by both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms and they\nalso express the genes for proteins involved in viral endocytosis and\nreplication. This knowledge will be useful for evidence-based patient\nmanagement for IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "abstract": "Conventional histopathology has long been essential for disease diagnosis,\nrelying on visual inspection of tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry aids in\ndetecting specific biomarkers but is limited by its single-marker approach,\nrestricting its ability to capture the full tissue environment. The advent of\nmultiplexed imaging technologies, like multiplexed immunofluorescence and\nspatial transcriptomics, allows for simultaneous visualization of multiple\nbiomarkers in a single section, enhancing morphological data with molecular and\nspatial information. This provides a more comprehensive view of the tissue\nmicroenvironment, cellular interactions, and disease mechanisms - crucial for\nunderstanding disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. However,\nthe extensive data from multiplexed imaging necessitates sophisticated\ncomputational methods for preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and\nspatial analysis. These tools are vital for managing large, multidimensional\ndatasets, converting raw imaging data into actionable insights. By automating\nlabor-intensive tasks and enhancing reproducibility and accuracy, computational\ntools are pivotal in diagnostics and research. This review explores the current\nlandscape of multiplexed imaging in pathology, detailing workflows and key\ntechnologies like PathML, an AI-powered platform that streamlines image\nanalysis, making complex dataset interpretation accessible for clinical and\nresearch settings.",

      "title": "A Precise Measure of Working Memory Reveals Subjects Difficulties\n  Managing Limited Capacity",
      "abstract": "Free recall consists of two separate stages: the emptying of working memory\nand reactivation [1]. The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, [2]) uses double\ninteger items to separate out only the first stage by making it difficult to\nreactivate items due to the lack of intra-item relationships. 193 Russian\ncollege students were tested via the internet version of the TUT. The average\nnumber of items remembered in the 3 item test was 2.54 items. In the 4 item\ntest, the average number of items decreased to 2.38. This, and a number of\nother qualitative distribution differences between the 3 and 4 item tests,\nindicates that the average capacity limit of working memory has been reached at\n3 items. This provides the first direct measurement of the unchunkable capacity\nlimit of language based items. That the average number of items remembered\ndecreased as the number of items increased from 3 to 4 indicates that most\nsubjects were unable to manage their working memories as the number of items\nincreased just beyond the average capacity. Further evidence for the difficulty\nin managing the capacity limit is that 25% of subjects could not remember any\nitems correctly at least in one of three 4 item tests and that the Pearson\ncorrelation between the 3 item and 4 item subject recalls was a relatively\nsmall 38%. This failure of managing a basic memory resource should have\nimportant consequences for pedagogy including instruction, text book design and\ntest design. Because working memory scores are important for academic\nachievement, it also suggests that an individual can gain academically by\nlearning how to manage her or his capacity limit.",

      "abstract": "The speed of site-specific binding of transcription factor (TFs) proteins\nwith genomic DNA seems to be strongly retarded by the randomly occurring\nsequence traps. Traps are those DNA sequences sharing significant similarity\nwith the original specific binding sites. It is an intriguing question how the\nnaturally occurring TFs and their specific binding sites are designed to manage\nthe retarding effects of such randomly occurring traps. We develop a simple\nrandom walk model on the site-specific binding of TFs with genomic DNA in the\npresence of sequence traps. Our dynamical model predicts that (a) the retarding\neffects of traps will be minimum when the traps are arranged around the\nspecific binding site such that there is a negative correlation between the\nbinding strength of TFs with traps and the distance of traps from the specific\nbinding site and (b) the retarding effects of sequence traps can be appeased by\nthe condensed conformational state of DNA. Our computational analysis results\non the distribution of sequence traps around the putative binding sites of\nvarious TFs in mouse and human genome clearly agree well the theoretical\npredictions. We propose that the distribution of traps can be used as an\nadditional metric to efficiently identify the specific binding sites of TFs on\ngenomic DNA.",

      "abstract": "Malfunction of the system which regulates the bloodflow in the brain is a\nmajor cause of stroke and dementia, costing many lives and many billions of\npounds each year in the UK alone. This regulatory system, known as cerebral\nautoregulation, has been the subject of much experimental and mathematical\ninvestigation yet our understanding of it is still quite limited. One area in\nwhich our understanding is particularly lacking is that of the role of nitric\noxide, understood to be a potent vasodilator. The interactions of nitric oxide\nwith the better understood myogenic response remain un-modelled and poorly\nunderstood. In this thesis we present a novel model of the arteriolar control\nmechanism, comprising a mixture of well-established and new models of\nindividual processes, brought together for the first time. We show that this\nmodel is capable of reproducing experimentally observed behaviour very closely\nand go on to investigate its stability in the context of the vasculature of the\nwhole brain. In conclusion we find that nitric oxide, although it plays a\ncentral role in determining equilibrium vessel radius, is unimportant to the\ndynamics of the system and its responses to variation in arterial blood\npressure. We also find that the stability of the system is very sensitive to\nthe dynamics of Ca$^{2+}$ within the muscle cell, and that self-sustaining\nCa$^{2+}$ waves are not necessary to cause whole-vessel radius oscillations\nconsistent with vasomotion.",

One of its\nmost fascinating aspects is that a developing embryo can reliably recover from\ndisturbances, such as splitting into twins. While this reliability implies some\ntype of goal-seeking error minimization over a morphogenic field, there are\nmany gaps with respect to detailed, constructive models of such a process being\nused to implement the collective intelligence of cellular swarms. We describe a\nclosed-loop negative-feedback system for creating reaction-diffusion (RD)\npatterns with high reliability. It uses a cellular automaton to characterize a\nmorphogen pattern, then compares it to a goal and adjusts accordingly,\nproviding a framework for modeling anatomical homeostasis and robust generation\nof target morphologies. Specifically, we create a RD pattern with N\nrepetitions, where N is easily changeable. Furthermore, the individual\nrepetitions of the RD pattern can be easily stretched or shrunk under genetic\ncontrol to create, e.g., some morphological features larger than others.\nFinally, the cellular automaton uses a computation wave that scans the\nmorphogen pattern unidirectionally to characterize the features that the\nnegative feedback then controls. By taking advantage of a prior process\nasymmetrically establishing planar polarity (e.g., head vs. tail), our\nautomaton is greatly simplified. This work contributes to the exciting effort\nof understanding design principles of morphological computation, which can be\nused to understand evolved developmental mechanisms, manipulate them in\nregenerative medicine settings, or embed a degree of synthetic intelligence\ninto novel bioengineered constructs.",

      "abstract": "The Notch pathway plays a vital role in determining whether cells in the\nintestinal epithelium adopt a secretory or an absorptive phenotype. Cell fate\nspecification is coordinated via Notch's interaction with the canonical Wnt\npathway. Here, we propose a new mathematical model of the Notch and Wnt\npathways, in which the Hes1 promoter acts as a hub for pathway crosstalk.\nComputational simulations of the model can assist in understanding how healthy\nintestinal tissue is maintained, and predict the likely consequences of\nbiochemical knockouts upon cell fate selection processes. Chemical reaction\nnetwork theory (CRNT) is a powerful, generalised framework which assesses the\ncapacity of our model for monostability or multistability, by analysing\nproperties of the underlying network structure without recourse to specific\nparameter values or functional forms for reaction rates. CRNT highlights the\nrole of beta-catenin in stabilising the Notch pathway and damping oscillations,\ndemonstrating that Wnt-mediated actions on the Hes1 promoter can induce\ndynamical transitions in the Notch system, from multistability to\nmonostability. Time-dependent model simulations of cell pairs reveal the\nstabilising influence of Wnt upon the Notch pathway, in which beta-catenin- and\nDsh-mediated action on the Hes1 promoter are key in shaping the subcellular\ndynamics. Where Notch-mediated transcription of Hes1 dominates, there is Notch\noscillation and maintenance of fate flexibility; Wnt-mediated transcription of\nHes1 favours bistability akin to cell fate selection. Cells could therefore\nregulate the proportion of Wnt- and Notch-mediated control of the Hes1 promoter\nto coordinate the timing of cell fate selection as they migrate through the\nintestinal epithelium and are subject to reduced Wnt stimuli.",

      "abstract": "We present a model for continuous cell culture coupling intra-cellular\nmetabolism to extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor,\ntaking into account the growth capacity of the cell and the impact of toxic\nbyproduct accumulation. We provide a method to determine the steady states of\nthis system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity.\nWe demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale\nmetabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results\nthat are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. More\nimportantly, we derive a number of consequences from the model that are\nindependent of parameter values. First, that the ratio between cell density and\ndilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired\nmetabolic properties invariant across perfusion systems. This conclusion is\nrobust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model\nby the negative feedback loop on cell growth due to toxic byproduct\naccumulation. Moreover, a complex landscape of steady states in continuous cell\nculture emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches,\nwhich also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch\nculture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict\ninvariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A\npractical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for\nlarge-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of\nmetabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced. Thus, in order to actually\nreflect the expected behavior in perfusion, performance benchmarks of\ncell-lines and culture media should be carried out in a chemostat.",

      "abstract": "The critical importance of human milk to infants and even human civilization\nhas been well established. Although the human milk microbiome has received\nincreasing attention with the expansion of research on the human microbiome,\nour understanding of the milk microbiome has been limited to cataloguing OTUs\nand computation of community diversity indexes. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no report on the bacterial interactions within the human milk\nmicrobiome. To bridge this gap, we reconstructed a milk bacterial community\nnetwork with the data from Hunt et al (2011), which is the largest 16S-rRNA\nsequence data set of human milk microbiome available to date. Our analysis\nrevealed that the milk microbiome network consists of two disconnected\nsub-networks. One sub-network is a fully connected complete graph consisting of\nseven genera as nodes and all of its pair-wise interactions among the bacteria\nare facilitative or cooperative. In contrast, the interactions in the other\nsub-network of 8 nodes are mixed but dominantly cooperative. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the only 'non-cooperative' nodes in the second sub-network are\nmutually cooperative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium, genera that include\nsome opportunistic pathogens. This potentially 'evil' alliance between\nStaphylococcus and Corynebacterium could be inhibited by the remaining nodes\nwho cooperate with one another in the second sub-network. We postulate that the\n'confrontation' between the 'evil' alliance and 'benign' alliance in human milk\nmicrobiome should have important health implications to lactating women and\ntheir infants and shifting the balance between the two alliances may be\nresponsible for dysbiosis of the milk microbiome that permits mastitis.

      "abstract": "There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. One current\nfocus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic\nefficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially\nunknown. It is therefore challenging to discover a successful treatment to be\napproved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological\nprocesses of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS)\nthat play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These\ninclude why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of\nH2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why\nthe amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant\ndoses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced\nin the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in\nphagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification\nmechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions\nenhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological\nfunctions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling\nmolecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands\nof times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold\nin phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the\nstratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling\nmolecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can\ncause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and\ncancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of\ninvading pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), cancer and other\ndiseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or\ncandidates.",

      "abstract": "The pathogenesis and progression of many tumors, including hematologic\nmalignancies is highly dependent on enhanced lipogenesis. De novo fatty-acid\nsynthesis permits accelerated proliferation of tumor cells by providing\nstructural components to build the membranes. It may also lead to alterations\nof physicochemical properties of the formed membranes, which can have an impact\non signaling or even increase resistance to drugs in cancer cells. Cancer\ntype-specific lipid profiles would allow understanding the actual effects of\nlipid changes and therefore could potentially serve as fingerprints for\nindividual tumors and be explored as diagnostic markers. We have used shotgun\nMS approach to identify lipid patterns in different types of acute myeloid\nleukemia (AML) patients that either show no karyotype changes or belong to\nt(8;21) or inv16 types. The observed differences in lipidomes of t(8;21) and\ninv(16) patients, as compared to AML patients without karyotype changes,\nconcentrate mostly on substantial modulation of ceramides/sphingolipids\nsynthesis. Also significant changes in the physicochemical properties of the\nmembranes, between the t(8;21) and the other patients, were noted that were\nrelated to a marked alteration in the saturation levels of lipids. The revealed\ndifferences in lipid profiles of various AML types increase our understanding\nof the affected biochemical pathways and can potentially serve as diagnostic\ntools.",

      "abstract": "The apelinergic system is an important player in the regulation of both\nvascular tone and cardiovascular function, making this physiological system an\nattractive target for drug development for hypertension, heart failure and\nischemic heart disease. Indeed, apelin exerts a positive inotropic effect in\nhumans whilst reducing peripheral vascular resistance. In this study, we\ninvestigated the signaling pathways through which apelin exerts its hypotensive\naction. We synthesized a series of apelin-13 analogs whereby the C-terminal\nPhe13 residue was replaced by natural or unnatural amino acids. In HEK293 cells\nexpressing APJ, we evaluated the relative efficacy of these compounds to\nactivate G{\\alpha}i1 and G{\\alpha}oA G-proteins, recruit \\b{eta}-arrestins 1\nand 2 (\\b{eta}arrs), and inhibit cAMP production. Calculating the transduction\nratio for each pathway allowed us to identify several analogs with distinct\nsignaling profiles. Furthermore, we found that these analogs delivered i.v. to\nSprague-Dawley rats exerted a wide range of hypotensive responses. Indeed, two\ncompounds lost their ability to lower blood pressure, while other analogs\nsignificantly reduced blood pressure as apelin-13. Interestingly, analogs that\ndid not lower blood pressure were less effective at recruiting \\b{eta}arrs.\nFinally, using Spearman correlations, we established that the hypotensive\nresponse was significantly correlated with \\b{eta}arr recruitment but not with\nG protein- dependent signaling. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that\nthe \\b{eta}arr recruitment potency is involved in the hypotensive efficacy of\nactivated APJ.",

      "abstract": "Despite widespread and striking examples of physiological oscillations, their\nfunctional role is often unclear. Even glycolysis, the paradigm example of\noscillatory biochemistry, has seen questions about its oscillatory function.\nHere, we take a systems approach to summarize evidence that oscillations play\ncritical physiological roles. Oscillatory behavior enables systems to avoid\ndesensitization, to avoid chronically high and therefore toxic levels of\nchemicals, and to become more resistant to noise. Oscillation also enables\ncomplex physiological systems to reconcile incompatible conditions such as\noxidation and reduction, by cycling between them, and to synchronize the\noscillations of many small units into one large effect. In pancreatic beta\ncells, glycolytic oscillations are in synchrony with calcium and mitochondrial\noscillations to drive pulsatile insulin release, which is pivotal for the liver\nto regulate blood glucose dynamics. In addition, oscillation can keep\nbiological time, essential for embryonic development in promoting cell\ndiversity and pattern formation. The functional importance of oscillatory\nprocesses requires a rethinking of the traditional doctrine of homeostasis,\nholding that physiological quantities are maintained at constant equilibrium\nvalues, a view that has largely failed us in the clinic. A more dynamic\napproach will enable us to view health and disease through a new light and\ninitiate a paradigm shift in treating diseases, including depression and\ncancer. This modern synthesis also takes a deeper look into the mechanisms that\ncreate, sustain and abolish oscillatory processes, which requires the language\nof nonlinear dynamics, well beyond the linearization techniques of equilibrium\ncontrol theory.",

      "abstract": "Nymphaea caerulea is a valuable freshwater aquatic plant, not only because of\nits ornamental value but also its extractions for chemical and medical uses. It\nis necessary to store its seeds as backup resources. Cryopreservation is the\nreliable, cost-effective method for long-term preservation of botanical genetic\nbanks, especially for recalcitrant plants. In this study, we demonstrated that\ndue to unable to tolerate desiccation and low-temperature, N. caerulea is\nrecalcitrant. Since viability was lost before 6 months storage, N. caerulea\nseeds were not appropriate to long-term store by traditional storage method.\nThe only way to long-term store N. caerulea seeds is cryopreservation. However,\nPlant Vitrification Solution 3 (PVS3; 50% w/v sucrose, 50% w/v glycerol), a\ncommonly used plant vitrification solution, was ineffective on N. caerulea\nseeds cryopreservation. The maximum survival rate of cryopreserved seeds\ntreated by PVS3 was only 23%. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) accumulation within seeds was the reason to cause inefficiency of\nPVS3 treated seeds cryopreservation. We developed a new plant vitrification\nsolution (PVS+), by adding glutathione (GSH) into PVS3. PVS+ rescued the\ninefficiency by decreasing ROS accumulation and elevated survival rate of\ncryopreserved seeds to 97%. Our results showed some inefficiencies of plant\ntissue cryopreservation may be caused by ROS-induced oxidative stress.\nAntioxidants can reduce ROS-induced oxidative stress and improve seeds survival\nafter cryopreservation. In conclusion, N. caerulea seeds were identified as\nrecalcitrant and successfully cryopreserved. Suppressing ROS accumulation\nduring cryopreservation may be a potential strategy to improve survival rate of\nrecalcitrant seeds after cryopreservation.",

We sequenced the genome of the\ndiploid meiotic parthenogen Meloidogyne floridensis, and use a comparative\ngenomic approach to test the hypothesis that it was involved in the hybrid\norigin of the tropical mitotic parthenogen M. incognita. Phylogenomic analysis\nof gene families from M. floridensis, M. incognita and an outgroup species M.\nhapla was used to trace the evolutionary history of these species' genomes,\ndemonstrating that M. floridensis was one of the parental species in the hybrid\norigins of M. incognita. Analysis of the M. floridensis genome revealed many\ngene loci present in divergent copies, as they are in M. incognita, indicating\nthat it too had a hybrid origin. The triploid M. incognita is shown to be a\ncomplex double-hybrid between M. floridensis and a third, unidentified parent.\nThe agriculturally important RKN have very complex origins involving the mixing\nof several parental genomes by hybridization and their extreme polyphagy and\nagricultural success may be related to this hybridization, producing\ntransgressive variation on which natural selection acts. Studying RKN variation\nvia individual marker loci may fail due to the species' convoluted origins, and\nmulti-species population genomics is essential to understand the hybrid\ndiversity and adaptive variation of this important species complex.

      "abstract": "Antibodies and humoral memory are key components of the adaptive immune\nsystem. We consider and computationally model mechanisms by which humoral\nmemory present at baseline might instead increase infection load; we refer to\nthis effect as EI-HM (enhancement of infection by humoral memory). We first\nconsider antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) in which antibody enhances the\ngrowth of the pathogen, typically a virus, and typically at intermediate\n\"Goldilocks\" levels of antibody. Our ADE model reproduces ADE in vitro and\nenhancement of infection in vivo from passive antibody transfer. But notably\nthe simplest implementation of our ADE model never results in EI-HM. Adding\ncomplexity, by making the cross-reactive antibody much less neutralizing than\nthe de novo generated antibody or by including a sufficiently strong\nnon-antibody immune response, allows for ADE-mediated EI-HM. We next consider\nthe possibility that cross-reactive memory causes EI-HM by crowding out a\npossibly superior de novo immune response. We show that, even without ADE,\nEI-HM can occur when the cross-reactive response is both less potent and\n\"directly\" (i.e. independently of infection load) suppressive with regard to\nthe de novo response. In this case adding a non-antibody immune response to our\ncomputational model greatly reduces or completely eliminates EI-HM, which\nsuggests that \"crowding out\" is unlikely to cause substantial EI-HM. Hence, our\nresults provide examples in which simple models give qualitatively opposite\nresults compared to models with plausible complexity.

      "title": "Optical Screening of Citrus Leaf Diseases Using Label-Free Spectroscopic\n  Tools: A Review",
      "abstract": "Citrus diseases pose threats to citrus farming and result in economic losses\nworldwide. Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and,\nimmunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are\nlaborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and\ncontamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising\nalternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and\ndemonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for\ndisease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical\nspectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial\nphases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and\ncommercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental\nworking principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and\nlimitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic\nimaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in\ncitrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of\noptical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field\nmeasurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf\nspectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including\nfuture insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover,\nthe role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools\nfor spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus\nleaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging\ncompositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant\nleaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development\nand commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid\nand early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.",

In India, a\nmajority of people rely upon traditional Indian medicine to treat human\nmaladies due to less-cost, easier availability and without any side-effect.\nThese medicines are made by herbal plants. This study aims to assess the Indian\nherbal plants in the pursuit of potential COVID-19 inhibitors using in silico\napproaches. We have considered 18 extracted compounds of 11 different species\nof these plants. Our calculated lipophilicity, aqueous solubility and binding\naffinity of the extracted compounds suggest that the inhibition potentials in\nthe order; harsingar > aloe vera > giloy > turmeric > neem > ashwagandha > red\nonion > tulsi > cannabis > black pepper. On comparing the binding affinity with\nhydroxychloroquine, we note that the inhibition potentials of the extracts of\nharsingar, aloe vera and giloy are very promising.

      "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems are an adaptive immunity that protects prokaryotes against\nforeign genetic elements. Genetic templates acquired during past infection\nevents enable DNA-interacting enzymes to recognize foreign DNA for destruction.\nDue to the programmability and specificity of these genetic templates,\nCRISPR-Cas systems are potential alternative antibiotics that can be engineered\nto self-target antimicrobial resistance genes on the chromosome or plasmid.\nHowever, several fundamental questions remain to repurpose these tools against\ndrug-resistant bacteria. For endogenous CRISPR-Cas self-targeting,\nantimicrobial resistance genes and functional CRISPR-Cas systems have to\nco-occur in the target cell. Furthermore, these tools have to outplay DNA\nrepair pathways that respond to the nuclease activities of Cas proteins, even\nfor exogenous CRISPR-Cas delivery. Here, we conduct a comprehensive survey of\nCRISPR-Cas genomes. First, we address the co-occurrence of CRISPR-Cas systems\nand antimicrobial resistance genes in the CRISPR-Cas genomes. We show that the\naverage number of these genes varies greatly by the CRISPR-Cas type, and some\nCRISPR-Cas types (IE and IIIA) have over 20 genes per genome. Next, we\ninvestigate the DNA repair pathways of these CRISPR-Cas genomes, revealing that\nthe diversity and frequency of these pathways differ by the CRISPR-Cas type.\nThe interplay between CRISPR-Cas systems and DNA repair pathways is essential\nfor the acquisition of new spacers in CRISPR arrays. We conduct simulation\nstudies to demonstrate that the efficiency of these DNA repair pathways may be\ninferred from the time-series patterns in the RNA structure of CRISPR repeats.\nThis bioinformatic survey of CRISPR-Cas genomes elucidates the necessity to\nconsider multifaceted interactions between different genes and systems to\ndesign effective CRISPR-based antimicrobials.",

In particular, it is shown that heart rate and\nrespiration typically change shortly after body temperature, and aortic blood\npressure follows.

We describe several complementary methods using\nlarge-scale homology modeling of human protein complexes to detect non-neutral\nmutations. Importantly, unlike sequence conservation-based methods, this\nstructure-based approach provides experimentally testable biochemical\nmechanisms for mutations in disease. Specifically, we infer metal ion, small\nmolecule, protein-protein, and nucleic acid binding sites by homology and find\nthat disease-associated missense mutations are more prevalent in each class of\nbinding site than are neutral mutations. Importantly, our approach identifies\nconsiderably more binding sites than those annotated in the RefSeq database.\nFurthermore, an analysis of metal ion and protein-protein binding sites\npredicted by machine learning shows a similar preponderance of\ndisease-associated mutations in these sites. We also derive a statistical score\nfor predicting how mutations affect metal ion binding and find many dbSNP\nmutations that likely disrupt ion binding but were not previously considered\ndeleterious. We also cluster mutations in the protein structure to discover\nputative functional regions.

Nuquantus is an adaptive framework that learns the\nmorphological attributes of intact tissue in the presence of anatomical\nvariability and pathological processes. Nuquantus allowed us to robustly\nperform quantitative image analysis on remodeling cardiac tissue after\nmyocardial infarction. Nuquantus reliably classifies cardiomyocyte versus\nnon-cardiomyocyte nuclei and detects cell proliferation, as well as cell death\nin different cell classes.

Methods: The Vertebrate\nBreed Ontology (VBO) was created from breed names and related information\ncompiled from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,\nbreed registries, communities, and experts, using manual and computational\napproaches. Each breed is represented by a VBO term that includes breed\ninformation and provenance as metadata.

Breeds are\nclassified based on community and expert conventions (e.g., cattle breed) and\nsupported by relations to the breed's genus and species indicated by National\nCenter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy terms. Relationships\nbetween VBO terms (e.g., relating breeds to their foundation stock) provide\nadditional context to support advanced data analytics. VBO term metadata\nincludes synonyms, breed identifiers/codes, and attributed cross-references to\nother databases.\n  Conclusion and clinical importance: The adoption of VBO as a source of\nstandard breed names in databases and veterinary electronic health records can\nenhance veterinary data interoperability and computability.",

      "title": "Pesti-Gen: Unleashing a Generative Molecule Approach for Toxicity Aware\n  Pesticide Design",
      "abstract": "Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy,\nmaking reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their\nwidespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these\npesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning\napplications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or\nregression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular\nstructures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose\nPesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders,\ndesigned to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first\ntime. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an\ninitial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure\nrepresentation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates\ntoxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple\ntoxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to\ngenerate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen\nachieves approximately 68\\% structural validity in generating new molecular\nstructures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and\nfeasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more\nsustainable pest management solutions.",

Wastewater genomic\nsurveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has arrived as an alternative to clinical genomic\nsurveillance, allowing to continuously monitor the prevalence of viral lineages\nin communities of various size at a fraction of the time, cost, and logistic\neffort and serving as an early warning system for emerging variants, critical\nfor developed communities and especially for underserved ones.

However,\nthe relative performance of bioinformatics methods used to measure relative\nlineage abundances from wastewater sequencing data is unknown, preventing both\nthe research community and public health authorities from making informed\ndecisions regarding computational tool selection. Here, we perform\ncomprehensive benchmarking of 18 bioinformatics methods for estimating the\nrelative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 (sub)lineages in wastewater by using data from\n36 in vitro mixtures of synthetic lineage and sublineage genomes. In addition,\nwe use simulated data from 78 mixtures of lineages and sublineages co-occurring\nin the clinical setting with proportions mirroring their prevalence ratios\nobserved in real data. Importantly, we investigate how the accuracy of the\nevaluated methods is impacted by the sequencing technology used, the associated\nerror rate, the read length, read depth, but also by the exposure of the\nsynthetic RNA mixtures to wastewater, with the goal of capturing the effects\ninduced by the wastewater matrix, including RNA fragmentation and degradation.",

The underlying mechanisms of\nenergy trapping and dissipation within LHCII are still debated. Various\nproposed models differ considerably in their molecular and kinetic detail, but\nare often based on different interpretations of very similar transient\nabsorption measurements of isolated complexes. Here we present a simulated\nmeasurement of the fluorescence decay kinetics of quenched LHCII aggregates to\ndetermine whether this relatively simple measurement can discriminate between\ndifferent potential NPQ mechanisms. We simulate not just the underlying physics\n(excitation, energy migration, quenching and singlet-singlet annihilation) but\nalso the signal detection and typical experimental data analysis. Comparing\nthis to a selection of published fluorescence decay kinetics we find that: (1)\nDifferent proposed quenching mechanisms produce noticeably different\nfluorescence kinetics even at low (annihilation free) excitation density,\nthough the degree of difference is dependent on pulse width. (2) Measured decay\nkinetics are consistent with most LHCII trimers becoming relatively slow\nexcitation quenchers. A small sub-population of very fast quenchers produces\nkinetics which do not resemble any observed measurement. (3) It is necessary to\nconsider at least two distinct quenching mechanisms in order to accurately\nreproduce experimental kinetics, supporting the idea that NPQ is not a simple\nbinary switch switch.",

In this\nstudy, we identified the modular communities to explore the relation of this\ncommon causative pathogen (EBV) with different carcinomas such as GC, NPC, HL\nand BL. We could identify the top 10 genes as CASP10, BRAF, NFKBIA, IFNA2,\nGSTP1, CSF3, GATA3, UBR5, AXIN2 and POLE based on their degree of distribution.\nFurther over-representation analysis showed that the ABL1 gene was\nsignificantly over-represented in 3 out of 9 critical biological processes.

      "abstract": "Temperatures over the next century are expected to rise to levels detrimental\nto crop growth and yield. As the atmosphere warms without additional water\nvapor input, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases as well. Increased\ntemperatures and accompanied elevated VPD levels can both lead to negative\nimpacts on crop yield. The independent importance of VPD, however, is often\nneglected or conflated with that from temperature due to a tight correlation\nbetween the two climate factors. We used a coupled process-based crop (MAIZSIM)\nand soil (2DSOIL) model to gain a mechanistic understanding of the independent\nroles temperature and VPD play in crop yield projections, as well as their\ninteractions with rising CO2 levels and changing precipitation patterns. We\nfound that by separating out the VPD effect from rising temperatures, VPD\nincreases had a greater negative impact on yield compared to that from warming.\nThe negative impact of these two factors varied with precipitation levels and\ninfluenced yield through separate mechanisms. Warmer temperatures caused yield\nloss mainly through shortening the growing season, while elevated VPD increased\nwater loss and triggered several water stress responses such as reduced\nphotosynthetic rates, lowered leaf area development, and shortened growing\nseason length. Elevated CO2 concentrations partially alleviated yield loss\nunder warming or increased VPD conditions through water savings, but the impact\nlevel varied with precipitation levels and was most pronounced under drier\nconditions. These results demonstrate the key role VPD plays in crop growth and\nyield, displaying a magnitude of impact comparative to temperature and CO2. A\nmechanistic understanding of the function of VPD and its relation with other\nclimate factors and management practices is critical to improving crop yield\nprojections under a changing climate.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic heterogeneity is widely recognised as the next challenge in our\nunderstanding of non-genetic variation. A growing body of evidence suggests\nthat metabolic heterogeneity may result from the inherent stochasticity of\nintracellular events. However, metabolism has been traditionally viewed as a\npurely deterministic process, on the basis that highly abundant metabolites\ntend to filter out stochastic phenomena. Here we bridge this gap with a general\nmethod for prediction of metabolite distributions across single cells. By\nexploiting the separation of time scales between enzyme expression and enzyme\nkinetics, our method produces estimates for metabolite distributions without\nthe lengthy stochastic simulations that would be typically required for large\nmetabolic models. The metabolite distributions take the form of Gaussian\nmixture models that are directly computable from single-cell expression data\nand standard deterministic models for metabolic pathways. The proposed mixture\nmodels provide a systematic method to predict the impact of biochemical\nparameters on metabolite distributions. Our method lays the groundwork for\nidentifying the molecular processes that shape metabolic heterogeneity and its\nfunctional implications in disease.",

      "abstract": "Malaria disease is a major global health and economic development threat. It\nresults in approximately 2.7 million deaths annually. There is currently no\nvaccine that has been licensed for use against malaria. Studies in animal\nmodels, especially non-human primates can lead to the revelation of possible\nimmunological mechanisms that can lead to protection or predisposition of the\nhost to malaria. Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian and human malaria parasite, is\nan attractive experimental parasite for malaria research since it can infect\nolive baboons (Papio anubis), non-human primates that have similar\nhost-pathogen interactions to humans. This study was carried out to determine\nhost immunological profiles provoked in olive baboons during the course of an\ninfection with Plasmodium knowlesi. A total of eight adult baboons were\nintravenously inoculated with overnight cultured blood stage P. knowlesi H\nstrain parasites. Five of these baboons became acutely infected while the other\nthree became chronically infected. The immunological basis of this dual outcome\nof the infection was determined by measuring circulating cytokine (T helper 1\nand T helper 2) and antibody (immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M) responses\nelicited in the infected baboons on a weekly basis by Enzyme Linked\nImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for up to six weeks post infection. Generated data\nfor the first time indicated that acute P. knowlesi malaria is accompanied by\nincreased concentrations of interferon gamma (IFN gamma), tumour necrosis\nfactor alpha (TNF alpha) and IL 6 and reduced levels of circulating interleukin\n10 (IL 10), IL 4, IL 12, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM in the baboon host.\nThese results are largely agreeable with data from human studies, thereby\nincreasing the relevance of the olive baboon - P. knowlesi experimental\ninfection system for future malaria studies.",

Mechanotransduction provides\nthe link between modulation of the extracellular matrix and intracellular\nactions. By controlling the balance between the intracellular and extracellular\ndomains, the mechanotransduction process determines optimal functionality of\nthe skeletal dynamics, and it is one of the possible causes of\nosteophatological diseases.\n  Results: Mechanotransduction in a single osteoblast under external mechanical\nperturbations has been modelled in the agent based framework to reproduce the\ndynamics of the stochastic reaction diffusion process among molecules in the\ncytoplasm, nuclear and extracellular domains. The amount of molecules and\nfluctuations of each molecular class has been analysed in terms of recurrences\nof critical events. A numerical approach has been developed to invert\nsubordination processes and to extract the directing processes from the\nmolecular signals in order to derive the distribution of recurrence of events.\n  Conclusions: We observed large fluctuations enclose information hidden in the\nnoise which is beyond the dynamic variations of molecular baselines. Studying\nthe system under different parametric conditions and stimuli, the results have\nshown that the waiting time distributions of each molecule are a signature of\nthe system's dynamics. The behaviours of the molecular waiting times change\nwith the changing of parameters presenting the same variation of patterns for\nsimilar interacting molecules and identifying specific alterations for key\nmolecules in the mechanotransduction pathway.",

      "title": "The effect of spatial scales on the reproductive fitness of plant\n  pathogens",
      "abstract": "Plant diseases often cause serious yield losses in agriculture. A pathogen's\nreproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.\nSince pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial\nseparation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of\npathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic\nreproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field\nsizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a\nmaximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This\npattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that\ndecrease exponentially or faster as well as for \"fat-tailed\" dispersal kernels\nthat decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this\napproach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by\nPuccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were\nthoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,\n95, 983 (2005)]. For the two largest datasets, we estimated R0 in the limit of\nlarge fields to be of the order of 50. These estimates are consistent with\nindependent field observations [Cowger et al. (2005), Phytopathology, 95,\n97282; Farber et al. (2013), Phytopathology, 103, 41]. We present a proof of\nprinciple of a novel approach to estimate the basic reproductive number, R0, of\nplant pathogens using wheat stripe rust as a case study. We found that the\nspatial extent over which R0 changes strongly is quite fine-scaled (about 30 m\nof the linear extension of the field). Our results indicate that in order to\noptimize the spatial scale of deployment of fungicides or host resistances, the\nadjustments should be made at a fine spatial scale.",

      "abstract": "One of the main reasons we have not been able to cure cancers is that drugs\nselect for drug-resistant cancer cells. Pest managers face similar challenges\nwith pesticides selecting for pesticide-resistant organisms. Lessons in pest\nmanagement have led to four heuristics that can be translated to controlling\ncancers 1. limit use (of chemical controls or modes of action to the lowest\npractical levels) 2. diversify use (of modes of action largely through\nrotations of chemical controls) 3. partition chemistry (modes of action through\nspace and time, which in effect is a refuge management strategy) and 4. include\nnon-chemical methods. These principles are general to all cancers and cancer\ndrugs, and thus should be employed to improve oncology. We review the parallel\ndifficulties in controlling the evolution of drug resistance in pests and\ncancer cells, and describe the results of single- and multi-drug strategies in\nagriculture and oncology. We dissect the methods that pest managers use to\nprevent the evolution of pesticide resistance, showing how integrated pest\nmanagement inspired the development of adaptive therapy in oncology to\nstabilize tumor size, and increase progression-free survival and quality of\nlife of patients. Finally, we demonstrate these principles in a proposal for\nclinical trials in colorectal cancer.",

      "title": "Integrative AI-Driven Strategies for Advancing Precision Medicine in\n  Infectious Diseases and Beyond: A Novel Multidisciplinary Approach",
      "abstract": "Precision medicine, tailored to individual patients based on their genetics,\nenvironment, and lifestyle, shows promise in managing complex diseases like\ninfections. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into precision medicine\ncan revolutionize disease management. This paper introduces a novel approach\nusing AI to advance precision medicine in infectious diseases and beyond. It\nintegrates diverse fields, analyzing patients' profiles using genomics,\nproteomics, microbiomics, and clinical data. AI algorithms process vast data,\nproviding insights for precise diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. AI-driven\npredictive modeling empowers healthcare providers to make personalized and\neffective interventions. Collaboration among experts from different domains\nrefines AI models and ensures ethical and robust applications. Beyond\ninfections, this AI-driven approach can benefit other complex diseases.\nPrecision medicine powered by AI has the potential to transform healthcare into\na proactive, patient-centric model. Research is needed to address privacy,\nregulations, and AI integration into clinical workflows. Collaboration among\nresearchers, healthcare institutions, and policymakers is crucial in harnessing\nAI-driven strategies for advancing precision medicine and improving patient\noutcomes.",

      "abstract": "Human life expectancy has dramatically improved over the course of the last\ncentury. Although this reflects a global improvement in sanitation and medical\ncare, this also implies that more people suffer from diseases that typically\nmanifest later in life, like Alzheimer and atherosclerosis. Increasing\nhealthspan by delaying or reverting the development of these age-related\ndiseases has therefore become an urgent challenge in biomedical research.\nResearch in this field is complicated by the multi-factorial nature of\nage-related diseases. They are rooted in complex physiological mechanisms\nimpacted by heritable, environment and life-style factors that can be unique to\neach individual. Although technological advances in high-throughput\nbiomolecular assays have enabled researchers to investigate individual\nphysiology at the molecular level, integrating information about its different\ncomponents, and accounting for individual variations remains a challenge. We\nare using a large collection of omics and phenotype data derived from the BXD\nmouse genetic diversity panel to explore how good data management practices, as\nfostered by the FAIR principles, paired with an explainable artificial\nintelligence framework, can provide solutions to decipher the complex roots of\nage-related diseases. These developments will help to propose innovative\napproaches to extend healthspan in the aging global population.",

      "title": "Can high risk fungicides be used in mixtures without selecting for\n  fungicide resistance?",
      "abstract": "Fungicide mixtures produced by the agrochemical industry often contain\nlow-risk fungicides, to which fungal pathogens are fully sensitive, together\nwith high-risk fungicides known to be prone to fungicide resistance. Can these\nmixtures provide adequate disease control while minimizing the risk for the\ndevelopment of resistance? We present a population dynamics model to address\nthis question. We found that the fitness cost of resistance is a crucial\nparameter to determine the outcome of competition between the sensitive and\nresistant pathogen strains and to assess the usefulness of a mixture. If\nfitness costs are absent, then the use of the high-risk fungicide in a mixture\nselects for resistance and the fungicide eventually becomes nonfunctional. If\nthere is a cost of resistance, then an optimal ratio of fungicides in the\nmixture can be found, at which selection for resistance is expected to vanish\nand the level of disease control can be optimized.",

      "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role on improving soil\nconditions and soil functions. Increasing land use changes have induced an\nimportant decline of SOC content at global scale. Increasing SOC in\nagricultural soils has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate climate change.\nAnimal manure has the characteristic of enriching SOC, when applied to crop\nfields, while, in parallel, it could constitute a natural fertilizer for the\ncrops. In this paper, a simulation is performed using the area of Catalonia,\nSpain as a case study for the characteristic low SOC in the Mediterranean, to\nexamine whether animal manure can improve substantially the SOC of agricultural\nfields, when applied as organic fertilizers. Our results show that the policy\ngoals of the 4x1000 strategy can be achieved only partially by using manure\ntransported to the fields. This implies that the proposed approach needs to be\ncombined with other strategies.",
