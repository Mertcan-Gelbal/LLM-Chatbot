The GRAPE-3A can e\ufb03ciently calculate gravitational force between particles, and construct neighbor lists. All other calculations are performed on the host workstation (WS) which is directly connected to GRAPE. The use of GRAPE for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (GRAPE-SPH) can in principle greatly speed up the calculations on WS. However the current bottleneck of GRAPE-SPH is that its performance is limited by the speed of the host WS. To solve this problem, we implement Remote-GRAPE; it allows us to run applications which use GRAPE-3A hardware on the signi\ufb01cantly faster computers than the physical host WS. Thus, we can take advantage of the fast computers even though they can not physically be connected to GRAPE. The Remote-GRAPE system is implemented on the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM). The detail of implementation is described. We analyze the performance of Remote-GRAPE and obtain the following results. 1) When Remote-GRAPE is used to calculate only gravitational forces, the overhead due to the network decrease according to the number of particles (20 % - 40 % of total time). 2) To calculate gravity and neighbor lists, the overhead due to the network does not occupy a large fraction of total time but only \u223c20 - 30 %, because the computation required on the slave machine (see text) is very large due to the property of GRAPE system. 3) We also compare the performance of Remote-GRAPE with the tree method. The tree method requires more time for higher degree of clustering, while the required time for Remote-GRAPE does not much depend on it. We then analyze the performance of GRAPE-SPH with Remote-GRAPE. Its performance is about 4 times faster than GRAPE-SPH with usual GRAPE for our con\ufb01guration. Using Remote-GRAPE, we can calculate the GRAPE part 1Department of Astronomy, School of Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113 2The Institute of Astronomy, Faculty of Science, University of Tokyo, Mitaka, Tokyo 181, Japan 3Research Center for the Early Universe, School of Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113",

Applying a non-Bayesian time-varying model approach to the fundamental equation for spot returns and the futures premium, we detect when e\ufb03ciency reductions in the two major rice mar- kets occurred. We also examine how government interventions a\ufb00ected the rice markets in Japan, which colonized Taiwan and Korea before World War II, and argue that the function of rice futures markets crucially depended on the di\ufb00erences in rice spot market\u2019s structure. The increased volume of imported rice of a di\ufb00erent variety from domestic rice \ufb01rst disrupted the rice futures. Then, government intervention in the rice futures markets failed to improve the disruption. Changes in colonial rice cropping successfully improved the disruption, and colonial rice was promoted to unify the di\ufb00erent varieties of inland and colonial rice.

Abstract This study presents a novel approach at the intersection of genomic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict viral mutations and assess the risks of future pandemics. Through comprehensive genomic analysis, genetic markers associated with increased virulence and transmissibility are identified. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze genetic data and forecast viral mutations, taking into account factors such as replication rates, host-pathogen interactions, and environmental influences. The research also evaluates the risk of future pandemics by examining zoonotic reservoirs, human-animal interfaces, and climate change impacts. AI-powered risk assessment models provide insights into potential outbreak hotspots, facilitating targeted surveillance and preventive measures. This research offers a proactive approach to pandemic preparedness, enabling early intervention and the development of effective containment strategies and vaccines. The fusion of genomic analysis and AI enhances our ability to mitigate the impact of infectious diseases on a global scale, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding public health. Keywords: Genomic analysis, artificial intelligence, viral mutations, future pandemics, predictive modeling. *Corresponding author: Maithm Ghaly Yousif matham.yousif@qu.edu.iq m.g.alamran@ljmu.ac.uk",
